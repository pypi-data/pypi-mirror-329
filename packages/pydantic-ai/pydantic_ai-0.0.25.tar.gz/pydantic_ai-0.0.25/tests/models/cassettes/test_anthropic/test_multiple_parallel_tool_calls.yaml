          Based on the retrieved information, we can see the family relationships:
          - Alice and Bob are married
          - Charlie is their son
          - Daisy is their daughter and Charlie's younger sister

          Since Daisy is described as Charlie's younger sister, Daisy is the youngest in this family.

          The answer is: Daisy is the youngest.
