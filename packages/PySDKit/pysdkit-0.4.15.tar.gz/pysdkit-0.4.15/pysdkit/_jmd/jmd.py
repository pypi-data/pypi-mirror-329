    Jump Plus AM-FM Mode Decomposition

    Jump Plus AM-FM Mode Decomposition (JMD) is a novel method for decomposing a nonstationary signal into amplitude-
    and frequency-modulated (AM-FM) oscillations and discontinuous (jump) components.
    Current nonstationary signal decomposition methods are designed to either obtain constituent AM-FM oscillatory modes
    or the discontinuous and residual components from the data, separately. Yet, many real-world signals of interest
    simultaneously exhibit both behaviors i.e., jumps and oscillations.
    In JMD method, we design and solve a variational optimization problem to accomplish this task.
    The optimization formulation includes a regularization term to minimize the bandwidth of all signal modes for
    effective oscillation modeling, and a prior for extracting the jump component. JMD addresses the limitations of
    conventional AM-FM signal decomposition methods in extracting jumps, as well as the limitations of existing jump
    extraction methods in decomposing multiscale oscillations.
