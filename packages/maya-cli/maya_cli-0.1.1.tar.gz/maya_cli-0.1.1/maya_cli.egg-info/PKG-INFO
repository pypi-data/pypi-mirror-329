## ðŸ›  Maya CLI - AI Project Generator
Maya CLI is one of the core features of Maya.ai, designed to generate structured AI project templates. It helps AI developers quickly set up their projects with predefined folders and files, ensuring organization and scalability.

### ðŸ“¦ Installation Guide (For Dummies)

#### Step 1: Install Python
Maya CLI requires Python. To install Python:
- Download the latest version of Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Run the installer and ensure "Add Python to PATH" is checked
- Verify installation by running:
  ```sh
  python --version
  ```

#### Step 2: Install Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
Using a virtual environment helps manage dependencies. Install it using:
```sh
pip install virtualenv
```
To create and activate a virtual environment:
```sh
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
```

#### Step 3: Install Maya CLI
Maya CLI is available on PyPI. Install it using pip:
```sh
pip install maya-cli
```

### ðŸš€ Usage
Once installed, use the following command to create a new AI project:
```sh
maya create <project_name>
```
Example:
```sh
maya create my_ai_project
```
This will generate the following structure:
```
my_ai_project/
â”‚â”€â”€ data_source/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ingestion/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ processing/
