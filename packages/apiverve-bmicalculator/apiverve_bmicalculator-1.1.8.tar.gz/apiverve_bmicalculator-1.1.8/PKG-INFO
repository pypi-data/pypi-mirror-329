## Usage

The BMI Calculator API documentation is found here: [https://docs.apiverve.com/api/bmicalculator](https://docs.apiverve.com/api/bmicalculator).  
You can find parameters, example responses, and status codes documented here.

### Setup

```
# Import the client module
from apiverve_bmicalculator.apiClient import BmicalculatorAPIClient

###### Define Query

```
query = { "weight": 70,  "height": 170,  "unit": "metric" }
```

###### Simple Request

```
# Make a request to the API
result = api.execute(query)

# Print the result
print(result)
```

###### Example Response

```
{
  "status": "ok",
  "error": null,
  "data": {
    "height": "170 cm",
    "weight": "70 kg",
    "bmi": 24.221453287197235,
    "risk": "Low risk",
    "summary": "This weight is normal and you are healthy.",
    "recommendation": "A BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 falls within the 'normal' weight range according to the World Health Organization. This range is associated with the lowest health risk for conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers. However, it's important to note that BMI is not a perfect measure as it does not account for muscle mass, bone density, overall body composition, and racial and sex differences. Therefore, while it's a useful starting point, it should not be the only measure of one's health."
