    "            Step 1: Identify the Transformation Pattern\n",
    "            Looking at the provided examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "            Input 1 to Output 1: The input grid was a 3x3 matrix, and the output grid became a 9x9 matrix.\n",
    "            Input 2 to Output 2: The input grid was a 3x3 matrix, and the output grid became a 9x9 matrix.\n",
    "            Input 3 to Output 3: The input grid was a 3x3 matrix, and the output grid became a 9x9 matrix.\n",
    "            Input 4 to Output 4: The input grid was a 3x3 matrix, and the output grid became a 9x9 matrix.\n",
    "            Input 5 to Output 5: The input grid was a 3x3 matrix, and the output grid became a 9x9 matrix.\n",
    "            From this, we can infer that the transformation involves expanding the grid from 3x3 to 9x9. This suggests a magnification or duplication of the grid elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "            Step 2: Determine the Transformation Rule\n",
    "            Upon examining the relationship between input and output, we observe:\n",
    "\n",
    "            Each element of the 3x3 input grid seems to be expanded into a 3x3 block in the 9x9 output grid. For instance:\n",
    "            In Input 1, the 7 at position (1,2) of the input grid results in a 3x3 block of 7s at positions (4, 7) in the output grid.\n",
    "            Empty cells (with value 0) remain as 0 in the corresponding 3x3 blocks in the output grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "            Step 3: Apply the Transformation to Input 6\n",
    "            Let's now apply the transformation to Input 6:\n",

    "            Input 6:\n",

    "\n",
    "            The 7 at position (1,1) in the input should expand into a 3x3 block of 7s in the output.\n",
    "            The 0 at position (1,2) in the input should expand into a 3x3 block of 0s in the output.\n",
