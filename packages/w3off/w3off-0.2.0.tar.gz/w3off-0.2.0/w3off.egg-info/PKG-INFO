           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)

              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

[![Build and Test](https://github.com/roman-spiridonov/w3off/actions/workflows/build-and-test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/roman-spiridonov/w3off/actions/workflows/build-and-test.yml)

**`w3off`** (**W**eb3 **Off**line) is a collection of CLI utilities for offline wallet management. The intended use case is creation and signing of transactions offline.

Currently supports only `EVM` networks. Default configurations are specified for the following networks, but you can easily add more in [`chains.yaml`](w3off/chains.yaml):
* Ethereum (MainNet)
* Ethereum Sepolia (TestNet)
* Base 
* Arbitrum
* Binance (BnB) SmartChain
* Optimism (OP MainNet)
* Avalanche

**This is not a wallet!** The intention is for you to manage your own keys. `w3off` just provides utilities for you to be able to explore the blockchain and create (presumably, complex) transactions using your offline (cold) keys, stored elsewhere and never used while you are online. 

# Motivation
The project is spurred by the fact that vast majority of typical web3 wallets are *hot wallets* in a form of browser extension or mobile app. By design, any hot wallet would have to store the private key in memory and on disk (e.g. for cross-session state keeping and uninterrupted experience between the user sessions). Albeit encrypted, coupled with the fact that hot wallet is always online while browsing and using your device, it exposes you to additional attack vectors. 

In general, hot wallets are often focused on improving Web3 browsing experience, so although security is critical some reasonable compromises are being made.

If your goal is **low** number of transactions with **increased security** for larger amount of funds, having an offline wallet and the transactions constructed offline is a preference.

# Alternative solutions
**1. Hardware wallets**
Although highly recommended, hardware wallets can also be exposed to additional attack vectors, such as a *supply-chain attacks*. For example, you may be located in the region where sourcing directly from producer is not possible. Additional layer of software employed by hardware wallets also slightly increases the attack surface. Ultimately, you do not control the hardware of the wallet, and you have to trust the manufacturer and the supply chain. 

**2. Offline wallet alternatives**
There are some web3 wallets which provide support for offline transactions (e.g. using *software wallets*), such as:

*2.1) MEW* - Great for simple fund movements (ETH or ERC20 tokens), but if you want to construct a more complex transaction, such as staking your USDT for additional yield, or other smart contract interactions, this functionality is not supported. However, MEW's *"send offline" helper* is helpful and you can use it to broadcast signed transactions created with help of `w3off` utilities (specifically, `observer` and `signer`).\
*2.2) MyCrypto* - Unfortunately, this project is no longer supported and ceased to work.\
*2.3) AirGap* - The flow requires a mobile device.\
*2.4) Cast* (part of *Foundry*) - provides a lot of CLI utilities, but the primary use case is testing web3 applications.

How is `w3off` different?
- Guarantees offline signing
- CLI interphase
- Open-source
- Supports any EVM chains
- Supports any Smart Contract transactions (think lending, pooling, staking, exchanging your tokens and redeeming them for additional yield)
- Developed with security in mind

# High-Level Architecture

The solution consists of three modules, intended to be run one after the other:
1. `Observer`: Helps conveniently build the transaction (no key used)
2. `Signer`: Signs the transaction offline using your securely stored cold and encrypted keystore
3. `Sender`: Sends the signed (raw) transaction(s) (no key used)

# Configuration
You can configure the tool for your own use by following this sequence:
1) Configure chains and RPC providers in [`w3off/chains.yaml`](w3off/chains.yaml).
2) [Optional] Configure default values or preferences in [`w3off/config.py`](w3off/config.py).
3) The application aims to cache web requests to `w3off/cache.json` persistently (mostly, contract ABIs or bytecodes). Since this data rarely chages on the network, the cache is never invalidated by the utilities. Clean the cache manually as needed by removing this file, e.g. if you suspect smart contract info in it may be outdated.

If you are installing the `w3off` package with `pip`, you can put your settings to `~/.w3off` folder, i.e. `~/.w3off/chains.yaml`. In this case, this folder will be used for both settings and cache instead.

# Usage
Download the source code and execute the following in CLI to launch the tool in interactive mode. It will always prompt you before proceeding to next step so don't worry.
Prerequisite: `pip install` or `conda install` if needed.

At this point, there is no support for CLI parameters (only interactive mode).

Ensure tests pass before using on your side:
```
$ python -m unittest discover
```

Simple launch:
```
$ python -m w3off
```

Or launch one by one:
```
$ python -m observer
$ python -m signer
$ python -m sender
```

You can also do this:
```
# sign and send using transcation JSON from file
$ python -m signer < yourTx.json
$ python -m sender < rawTx.json
```

Or this:
```
# send raw transaction passed as a string
$ echo "0x..." | python -m sender  
```


Alternatively, you can install the executable scripts via `pip`:
```
$ pip install w3off
$ w3off
$ w3observer
$ w3signer
$ w3sender
```

```
$ w3off dataFromCall transfer(address,uint256) 0x5AD1F1Aa106B5Af3A4F9D8B095427Df95607a452 2002220000
