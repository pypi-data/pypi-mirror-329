# Thingy

Licence: GPL v3

Author: John Skilleter v0.99

Collection of shell utilities and configuration stuff for Linux and MacOS. Untested on other operating systems.

Permanently (for the forseeable future!) in a beta stage - usable, with a few rough edges, and probably with bugs when used in way I'm not expecting!

The following commands are documented in detail in the help output that can be displayed by running the command with the '--help' option.

This README just contains a summary of the functionality of each command.

# Git Repo Management

## multigit

Manage a collection of related git working trees.

This is intended for use in a situation where you have a collection of related git working trees organised in a directory hierarchy and not necessarily managed using git submodules or any other tool. It allows you to run git commands on multiple working trees at once, without navigating around the different working trees to do so.

Start by running ensuring that the default branch (e.g. `main`) is checked out in each of the working trees and, in the top-level directory, run `multigit init` to create the configuration file which, by default is called `multigit.toml` - this is just a text file that sets the configuration for each working tree in terms of name, origin, default branch and location.

The multigit command line format is:

    multigit OPTIONS COMMAND

Where COMMAND is an internal multigit command if it starts with a '+' and is a git command otherwise.

By default, when multigit is invoked with a git command, it runs a the command in each of the working trees selected by the command line options passed to multigit (if no options are specified then the command is run in all the working trees. 

The command takes a number of options that can be used to select the list of working trees that each of the subcommands that it supports runs in:

*--repos / -r* Allows a list of working trees to be specfied, either as the full or relative path, the name or a wildcard.

*--modified / -m* Run only in working trees containing locally modified files

*--branched / -b* Run only working trees where the current branch that is checked out is NOT the default branch

Multigit supports a small list of subcommands, each of which are prefixed with a `+` to distinguish them from Git commands:

*+init* - Create or update the configuration file

*+dir* - Given the name of a working tree, output the location within the multigit tree of that working tree if the name matches uniquely, or the name of the directory where the multigit configuration file resides if no parameter is specified.

*+config* - Print the name and location of the multigit configuration file.

Any command not prefixed with '+' is run in each of the working trees (filtered by the various multigit options) as a git command.

For example; `multigit -m commit -ab` would run `git commit -a` in each of the working trees that is branched and contains modified files.

The `+dir` command can be used with shell aliases (or their equivalent in the user's shell of choice) to create an alias to run, for example, `cd (multigit +dir "$@")` (Bash) or `cd (multigit +dir $argv)` (for the Fish shell) that would cd to the top level direcory.

# Miscellaneous Git Utilities

## gitprompt

Output a string containing colour-coded shell nesting level, current directory and git working tree status (intended to be used in the shell prompt).

# Git Extensions

Due to the way that the git command works, these can be run as they were additional git subcommands.

## git ca

Improved version of 'git commit --amend'. Updates files that are already in the commit and, optionally, adds and commits additional files.

## git cleanup

List or delete branches that have already been merged and delete tracking branches that are no longer on the remote.

## git co

Equivalent to 'git checkout' but with intelligent branch matching, so specifying a partial branch name will work if it uniquely matches an existing branch

## git parent

Attempt to determine the parent branch for the specified branch (defaulting to the current one)

## git update

Update the repo from the remote, rebase branches against their parents, optionally run git cleanup

## git wt

Output the top level directory of the git working tree or return an error if we are not in a git working tree.

## git review

Console-based git change review tool.

# General Commands

## addpath

Update a $PATH-type variable by adding or removing entries.

## docker-purge

Stop or kill docker instances and/or remove docker images.

## ffind

Simple file find utility - replaces the `find` command with something that is more human-friendly.

## linecount

Count lines of code in a directory tree organised by file type.

## py-audit

Query api.osv.dev to determine whether a specified version of a particular Python package is subject to known security vulnerabilities

## readable

Pipe for converting colour combinations to make them readable on a light background

## remdir

Recursively delete empty directories

## rmdupe

Search for duplicate files

## rpylint

Run pylint on all the Python source files in the current tree

## s3-sync

Synchronise files from S3 to local storage.

## strreplace

Simple search and replace utility for those times when trying to escape characters in a regexp to use sed is more hassle than it is worth.

## tfm

Console-based file-manager, similar to Midnight Commander but aiming to be better.

## tfparse

Read JSON Terraform output and convert back to human-readable text
This allows multiple errors and warnings to be reported as there's
no way of doing this directly from Terraform

## trimpath

Intelligently trim a path to fit a given width (used by gitprompt)

## venv-create

Create a script to create/update a virtual environment and run a python script in it.

## xchmod

Command to run chmod only on files that need it (only modifies files that don't have the required permissions already).

## yamlcheck

YAML validator - checks that a file is valid YAML (use yamllint to verify that it is nicely-formatted YAML).

# Obsolescent Utilities

These will be moved to the skilleter-extras package in due course.

## borger

Wrapper for the borg backup utility to make it easier to use with a fixed set of options.

## consolecolours

Display all available colours in the console.

## diskspacecheck

Check how much free space is available on all filesystems, ignoring read-only filesystems, /dev and tmpfs.

Issue a warning if any are above 90% used.

## gphotosync

Utility for syncing photos from Google Photos to local storage

## moviemover

Search for files matching a wildcard in a directory tree and move them to an equivalent location in a different tree

## phototidier

Perform various tidying operations on a directory full of photos:

* Remove leading '$' and '_' from filenames
* Move files in hidden directories up 1 level
* If the EXIF data in a photo indicates that it was taken on date that doesn't match the name of the directory it is stored in (in YYYY-MM-DD format) then it is moved to the correct directory, creating it if necessary.

All move/rename operations are carried out safely with the file being moved having
a numeric suffix added to the name if it conflicts with an existing file.

## photodupe

Search for duplicate images in a directory tree

## splitpics

Copy a directory full of pictures to a destination, creating subdiretories with a fixed number of pictures in each in the destination directory for use with FAT filesystems and digital photo frames.

## sysmon

Simple console system monitor

## window-rename

Monitor window titles and rename them to fit an alphabetical grouping in 'Appname - Document' format.

# Obsolescent Commands

These commands will probably be retired in future versions of Thingy

## ggit

Run a git command in all working trees under the current directory (superceded by multigit).

## ggrep

Run 'git grep' in all repos under the current directory (superceded by multigit).

## GitLab Commands

### git mr

Push a feature branch to GitLab and create a merge request

### gl

Command line for GitLab
