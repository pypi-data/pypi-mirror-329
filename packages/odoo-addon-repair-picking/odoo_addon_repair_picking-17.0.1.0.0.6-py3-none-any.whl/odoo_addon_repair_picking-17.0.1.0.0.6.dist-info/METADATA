This module extends the repair management functionality in Odoo,
providing additional options for handling the repair process in a more
customizable and efficient way. It allows the configuration of repair
steps based on specific business requirements and adds new picking types
for managing component addition and removal in repair orders.

The main features are:

- Customize repair steps: Choose between a 1-step, 2-step, or 3-step
  repair process.
- Add and recycle components during the repair process using separate
  picking types.
- Associate repair orders with pickings for improved traceability.
- Automatic creation of pickings and procurement routes based on the
  selected repair steps.
- Manage repair locations and routes more efficiently with warehouse
  settings.

Configuration
=============

1. Navigate to Inventory > Configuration > Warehouses, and select a
   warehouse.
2. In the "Repair Steps" field, choose between "Repair", "Pick
   component, repair", or "Pick component, repair, store removed
   component" to define the repair process.
3. Define the "Repair Location", "Add Component to Repair" picking type,
   "Recycle component from Repair" picking type, and "Repair Route" as
   needed.

Usage
=====

1. Navigate to Repair > Repair Orders and create a new repair order.
2. In the Operations tab, add components to be added or removed during
   the repair process.
3. Confirm the repair order. This will automatically generate the
   necessary pickings based on the configured repair steps.
4. Process the pickings as required during the repair process.
5. If the repair order needs to be canceled, all associated pickings
   that are not in "cancel" or "done" state will also be canceled
   automatically.
