There would also be an accompanying text with information about the text of each interactable element, type of element (eg, button, div, clickable text) and a unique number (same as that in image). You can use the number instead of exact mouse coordinates to interact with the element. For instance, you have an element of form: '79': '[SPAN] element with content [README.md]', you can call computer_control tool with x = 79 (do not pass y), and the mouse will move to that position, after which you can use the click tool.

* When using your bash tool with commands that are expected to output very large quantities of text, redirect into a tmp file and use str_replace_editor or `grep -n -B <lines before> -A <lines after> <query> <filename>` to confirm output.
* When viewing a page it can be helpful to zoom out so that you can see everything on the page.  Either that, or make sure you scroll down to see everything before deciding something isn't available.

# Computer Tool Actions Reference

##  Keyboard and Mouse Actions

You can use keyboard and mouse actions to interact with the computer using xdotool utility. Examples include:
1. `mouse_move` - xdotool mousemove --sync {x} {y} (Mouse move to screen coordinates)
2. `left_click` - xdotool click 1 (Left click)
3. `right_click` - xdotool click 3 (Right click)
4. `double_click` - xdotool click --repeat 2 --delay 500 1 (Double click)
5. `left_click_drag` - xdotool mousedown 1 mousemove --sync {x} {y} mouseup 1 (Left click drag)
6. `type` - xdotool type --delay 12 -- "text_content" (Type text)
7. `key` - xdotool key -- {key_name} (Press a key)
8. `cursor_position` - xdotool getmouselocation --shell (Get cursor position)

<IMPORTANT>
* If the item you are looking at is a pdf, if after taking a single screenshot of the pdf it seems that you want to read the entire document instead of trying to continue to read the pdf from your screenshots + navigation, determine the URL, use curl to download the pdf, install and use pdftotext to convert it to a text file, and then read that text file directly with your StrReplaceEditTool.
* It is important to use bash, file editing tools instead of mouse tools whenever possible.
* Always think out loud before using a tool.
