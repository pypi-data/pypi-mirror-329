## Overview

**Programming with Pixels (PwP)** is a modern framework for evaluating and developing Software Engineering (SWE) agents that interact with computers as humans do - through visual perception and basic actions like typing and clicking.

Our motivating hypothesis is that achieving general-purpose Software Engineering (SWE) agents requires a shift to **computer-use agents** that can interact with any IDE interface through screenshots and primitive actions, rather than through specialized tool APIs.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- Docker
- (Optional) NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support

### Using pip (Recommended)

```bash
pip install programming-with-pixels
```

### Development Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ProgrammingWithPixels/pwp.git
cd pwp
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

```python
from pwp import PwP
from pwp import PwPBench

# Create a basic environment
env = PwP(image_name='pwp_env')

# Take a screenshot
observation = env.render()
observation.save('screenshot.png')

# Execute a command
result = env.step("echo 'Hello, World!'")
print(result['output'])

# Try a benchmark task
bench = PwPBench('humaneval')
dataset = bench.get_dataset()
task_env = bench.get_env(dataset[0])
```

### Command Line Interface

For quicker testing, PwP also comes with a convenient command-line interface:

```bash
# Start an environment
pwp env --vnc

# List available benchmark tasks
pwp list

# Run a benchmark
pwp bench humaneval
```

## Examples

Check out the [examples](examples/) directory for demonstration scripts:

- [Quickstart](examples/quickstart.py): Complete walkthrough of PwP's capabilities, including environment interaction, benchmarks, and advanced features
- [Basic Demo](examples/demo.py): Simple environment setup and interaction showcase
- [Demo2](examples/demo2.py): Additional demonstration of PwP features

## Benchmark Tasks

PwP-Bench comes with a wide range of benchmark tasks for evaluating agents:

- **HumanEval**: Python coding problems
- **Design2Code**: Converting design mockups to code
- **ChartMimic**: Recreating charts from visual references
- **SWE-bench**: Software engineering tasks
- **And many more!**

You will first need to setup benchmarks for evaluating agents.
See the [benchmark documentation](pwp_bench/README.md) for more details.

## Evaluating Agents

For detailed examples, check out the agent implementations in the [src/pwp/agents](src/pwp/agents/) directory. Each agent type can be customized with different LLM backends and system prompts to optimize for various tasks.


## Building Custom Environments

### Build the Base Environment

```bash
# Build the base PWP environment
cd src/pwp/docker/
docker build -t pwp_env .
```

### Custom Environment

You can create custom Docker environments by extending the base image:

```dockerfile
FROM pwp_env

# Install additional dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    your-package-here \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Add custom files
COPY your-files /home/devuser/your-files
```

## Package Structure

The PwP package consists of several modules:

- `pwp.env`: Core environment module for managing Docker containers
- `pwp.bench`: Benchmark module with various programming tasks
- `pwp.agents`: Agent implementations for solving tasks
- `pwp.utils`: Utility functions for image processing and other helpers
- `pwp.tools`: Tools for agent interaction with environments
- `pwp.functions`: Function implementations for tools
- `pwp.prompts`: Prompt templates for different agent types

See the [package documentation](src/pwp/README.md) for more details on each module.
