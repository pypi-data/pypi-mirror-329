    """
    Executes an xdotool command after scaling coordinates in any mousemove subcommands.

    In xdotool, you can chain several subcommands (like "mousemove", "click", etc.) in one call.
    For the "mousemove" subcommand the syntax is:
    
        xdotool mousemove [options] <x> <y>

    where the coordinate pair is always the last two numeric arguments of the mousemove subcommand.
    For example:
      - "xdotool mousemove 395 64 click 1"
          -> The mousemove part is "mousemove 395 64" (the coordinates are the first two numeric tokens)
      - "xdotool mousemove --window 12345 300 400 click 1"
          -> The mousemove part is "mousemove --window 12345 300 400"
             and the coordinates are the last two numeric tokens ("300" and "400").

    This function:
      1. Uses shlex.split() to properly tokenize the command.
      2. Splits the tokens (after the initial "xdotool") into subcommands by checking
         against a set of known xdotool subcommands.
      3. For every subcommand named "mousemove", it locates its coordinate pair as the last
         two numeric tokens in its argument list, scales them, and updates them.
      4. Reassembles the command and executes it.
