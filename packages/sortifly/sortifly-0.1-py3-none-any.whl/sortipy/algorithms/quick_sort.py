def quick_sort(arr):
    """
    Quick Sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that selects a pivot element, 
    partitions the list into elements smaller and greater than the pivot, and recursively 
    sorts the partitions.

    Time Complexity:
        Best and Average Case: O(n log n) due to recursive partitioning.
        Worst Case: O(nÂ²) when the smallest or largest element is always chosen as the pivot.

    Space Complexity:
        O(log n) for recursive stack calls in the average case.
        O(n) in the worst case (when recursion depth is maximal).

    Args:
        arr (list): A list of elements to be sorted. The elements should be 
                    comparable (i.e., they should support comparison operators).

    Returns:
        list: The sorted list.
