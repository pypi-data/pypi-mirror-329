def selection_sort(arr):
    """
    The selection sort algorithm works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted portion 
    of the list and swapping it with the first unsorted element.

    Time Complexity:
        Best, Average, and Worst Case: O(nÂ²) because it always requires comparing every element with the rest.

    Space Complexity:
        O(1) as the sorting is done in-place, without using extra space.

    Args:
        arr (list): A list of elements to be sorted. The elements should be 
                    comparable (i.e., they should support comparison operators).

    Returns:
        list: The sorted list.
