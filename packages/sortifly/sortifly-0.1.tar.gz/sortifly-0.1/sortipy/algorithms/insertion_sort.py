def insertion_sort(arr):
    """
    The insertion sort algorithm builds the sorted list one element at a time.
    It takes each element from the unsorted portion and inserts it into its correct 
    position in the sorted portion of the list.

    Time Complexity:
        Best Case: O(n) when the list is already sorted.
        Average and Worst Case: O(nÂ²) due to the nested loops for comparisons and shifts.
    
    Space Complexity:
        O(1) as the sorting is done in-place, without using extra space.
    
    Args:
        arr (list): A list of elements to be sorted. The elements should be 
                    comparable (i.e., they should support comparison operators).
    
    Returns:
        arr (list): The sorted list.
