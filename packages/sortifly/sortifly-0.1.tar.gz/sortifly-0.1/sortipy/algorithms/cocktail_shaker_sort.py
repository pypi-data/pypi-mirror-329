def cocktail_shaker_sort(arr):
    """
    Cocktail Shaker Sort (also known as Bidirectional Bubble Sort) is a variation of 
    Bubble Sort that sorts in both directions on each pass through the list. This 
    reduces the number of swaps needed compared to regular Bubble Sort.

    Time Complexity:
        - Best Case: O(n) when the list is already sorted.
        - Average and Worst Case: O(nÂ²) due to the nested loops.

    Space Complexity:
        O(1) since sorting is done in-place.

    Args:
        arr (list): A list of elements to be sorted.

    Returns:
        list: The sorted list.

    Key Features:
        - More efficient than Bubble Sort in some cases.
        - Moves large elements to the end and small elements to the beginning 
          in a single iteration.
