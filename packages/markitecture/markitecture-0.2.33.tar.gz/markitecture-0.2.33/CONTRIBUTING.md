## How You Can Contribute

## Getting Started

Here's how to get started with contributing code or documentation:

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Start by forking the [Markitecture repository][markitecture] on GitHub (or your chosen platform).

2.  **Clone Your Fork:** Clone your forked repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/eli64s/markitecture.git
    cd markitecture
    ```

3.  **Create a Branch:** Create a new branch for your changes:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
    ```

    Use a descriptive branch name that reflects your changes (e.g., `bugfix/link-validation-edge-case`, `feature/new-feature`, `docs/update-readme`). This will help you and others easily identify the purpose of the branch.

4.  **Set Up Your Development Environment:**

    Follow these steps to get a development version of Markitecture up and running:

    1.  **Create a virtual environment:**

        ```bash
        make venv
        ```

    2.  **Install project dependencies:**

        ```bash
        make install
        make lock
        ```

    3.  **Install pre-commit hooks:**

        ```bash
        pre-commit install
        ```

5.  **Make Your Changes:** Implement your bug fix, feature, or documentation update.

6.  **Test Your Changes:** Ensure your changes don't break existing functionality by running the tests:

    ```bash
    make test
    ```

7.  **Commit Your Changes:** Commit your changes with clear and concise commit messages:

    ```bash
    git commit -m "fix: Resolved issue with link validation"
    ```

8.  **Push to Your Fork:** Push your branch to your forked repository:

    ```bash
    git push origin feature/your-feature-name
    ```

9.  **Open a Pull Request:** Go to the original Markitecture repository and open a pull request from your branch. Provide a clear description of your changes in the pull request.

## Code Style and Standards

*   We adhere to the [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide for Python code.
*   We use `ruff` for code formatting and linting. You can run it locally before committing:

    ```bash
    make format-and-lint
    ```
*   Add tests for any new features or bug fixes.
*   Document any new or changed functionality in the code using docstrings and, if necessary, update the user-facing documentation.
*   Keep your code clean, well-commented, and easy to understand.

## Code of Conduct
