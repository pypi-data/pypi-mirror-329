<Callout type="info">
  Markitecture represents a significant evolution in documentation tooling, offering enhanced Markdown management while maintaining the simplicity and flexibility that developers expect from modern documentation tools.
</Callout>

## Understanding Our Philosophy

At its core, Markitecture embraces three fundamental principles that guide every aspect of its design and implementation:

1. **Modular Documentation**: We've carefully designed our tools to break down large documentation files into manageable, logical sections while preserving context and structure.

2. **Developer-First Experience**: Every feature, command, and configuration option has been crafted with developer experience in mind. We believe documentation tools should enhance productivity, not hinder it.

3. **Flexibility Without Complexity**: Our lightweight architecture ensures efficient processing while maintaining the full feature set developers need for modern documentation management.

## Getting Started

Begin your journey with Markitecture through our straightforward installation process:

<Steps>
  ### Install the Package
  ```bash
  pip install -U markitecture
  ```

  ### Create Your First Split
  ```bash
  markitect --split.i README.md --split.settings.o docs/
  ```

  ### Generate MkDocs Configuration
  ```bash
  markitect --split.i README.md --split.settings.mkdocs
  ```
</Steps>

## Core Concepts

Understanding Markitecture begins with grasping its foundational concepts. Let's explore how our documentation management principles translate into practical patterns.

### Section Management

In traditional documentation, managing large files can become unwieldy. Markitecture introduces an intelligent approach where documents are split into logical sections while maintaining their hierarchical relationships. This creates more manageable and maintainable documentation while preserving context.

```python
from markitecture import MarkdownTextSplitter

# Example of section splitting
splitter = MarkdownTextSplitter()
sections = splitter.process_file(content)

# Each section maintains its hierarchy and references
for section in sections:
    print(f"Title: {section.title}")
    print(f"Level: {section.level}")
    print(f"References: {section.references}")
```

### Reference Link Management

Our reference link system ensures clean and maintainable documentation by:

- Converting inline links to reference-style format
- Managing reference definitions automatically
- Preserving only relevant references per section
- Ensuring consistent formatting

<Callout type="tip">
  Take advantage of our reference link converter to improve the maintainability of your documentation. The system automatically manages reference-style links while maintaining all original functionality.
</Callout>

## Advanced Features

As you become more familiar with Markitecture, you'll discover advanced features that set it apart:

### Link Validation

Our framework includes a sophisticated link validation system that helps maintain documentation quality:

```python
from markitecture import LinkValidator

# Configure and run link validation
validator = LinkValidator(timeout=10, max_workers=5)
results = validator.check_markdown_file("docs/index.md")

# Process validation results
for result in results:
    print(f"Status: {result['status']}")
    print(f"URL: {result['url']}")
    print(f"Line: {result['line']}")
```

### Development Tools

Markitecture comes with a comprehensive suite of documentation tools:

```python
# Configure advanced features
settings = {
    "heading_level": "##",
    "preserve_refs": True,
    "add_hr": True,
    "case_sensitive": False
}

# Generate MkDocs configuration
from markitecture.generators.mkdocs import MkDocsConfig
config = MkDocsConfig(
    docs_dir="docs/",
    site_name="My Documentation",
    enable_material=True
)
```
