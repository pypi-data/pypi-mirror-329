{/* ### Ideas for Documentation Health Scoring

Develop a sophisticated documentation quality assessment system that evaluates multiple dimensions:

1. Comprehensiveness of coverage
2. Technical accuracy (through code snippet validation)
3. Writing clarity and consistency
4. Information architecture
5. Examples and use case coverage

This would help teams identify gaps and maintain high documentation standards systematically.
