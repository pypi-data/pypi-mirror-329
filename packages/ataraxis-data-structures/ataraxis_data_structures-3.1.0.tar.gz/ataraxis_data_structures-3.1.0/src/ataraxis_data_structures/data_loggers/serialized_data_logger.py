class DataLogger:
    """Saves input data as an uncompressed byte numpy array (.npy) files using the requested number of cores and
    threads.

    This class instantiates and manages the runtime of a logger distributed over the requested number of cores and
    threads. The class exposes a shared multiprocessing Queue via the 'input_queue' property, which can be used to
    buffer and pipe the data to the logger from other Processes. The class expects the data to be first packaged into
    LogPackage class instance also available from this library, before it is sent to the logger via the queue object.

    Notes:
        Initializing the class does not start the logger processes! Call start() method to initialize the logger
        processes.

        Once the logger process(es) have been started, the class also initializes and maintains a watchdog thread that
        monitors the runtime status of the processes. If a process shuts down, the thread will detect this and raise
        the appropriate error to notify the user. Make sure the main process periodically releases GIL to allow the
        thread to assess the state of the remote process!

        This class is designed to only be instantiated once. However, for particularly demanding use cases with many
        data producers, the shared Queue may become the bottleneck. In this case, you can initialize multiple
        DataLogger instances, each using a unique instance_name argument.

        Tweak the number of processes and threads as necessary to keep up with the load and share the input_queue of the
        initialized DataLogger with all classes that need to log serialized data. For most use cases, using a
        single process (core) with 5-10 threads will be enough to prevent the buffer from filling up.
        For demanding runtimes, you can increase the number of cores as necessary to keep up with the demand.

        This class will log data from all sources and Processes into the same directory to allow for the most efficient
        post-runtime compression. Since all arrays are saved using the source_id as part of the filename, it is possible
        to demix the data based on its source during post-processing. Additionally, the sequence numbers of logged
        arrays are also used in file names to aid sorting saved data.

    Args:
        output_directory: The directory where the log folder will be created.
        instance_name: The name of the data logger instance. Critically, this is the name used to initialize the
            SharedMemory buffer used to control the child processes, so it has to be unique across all other
            Ataraxis codebase instances that also use shared memory.
        process_count: The number of processes to use for logging data.
        thread_count: The number of threads to use for logging data. Note, this number of threads will be created for
            each process.
        sleep_timer: The time in microseconds to delay between polling the queue. This parameter may help with managing
            the power and thermal load of the cores assigned to the data logger by temporarily suspending their
            activity. It is likely that delays below 1 millisecond (1000 microseconds) will not produce a measurable
            impact, as the cores execute a 'busy' wait sequence for very short delay periods. Set this argument to 0 to
            disable delays entirely.
        exist_ok: Determines how the class behaves if a SharedMemory buffer with the same name as the one used by the
            class already exists. If this argument is set to True, the class will destroy the existing buffer and
            make a new buffer for itself. If the class is used correctly, the only case where a buffer would already
            exist is if the class ran into an error during the previous runtime, so setting this to True should be
            safe for most runtimes.

    Attributes:
        _process_count: The number of processes to use for data saving.
        _thread_count: The number of threads to use for data saving. Note, this number of threads will be created for
            each process.
        _sleep_timer: The time in microseconds to delay between polling the queue.
        _name: Stores the name of the data logger instance.
        _output_directory: The directory where the log folder will be created.
        _started: A boolean flag used to track whether Logger processes are running.
        _mp_manager: A manager object used to instantiate and manage the multiprocessing Queue.
        _input_queue: The multiprocessing Queue used to buffer and pipe the data to the logger processes.
        _logger_processes: A tuple of Process objects, each representing a logger process.
        _terminator_array: A shared memory array used to terminate (shut down) the logger processes.
        _watchdog_thread: A thread used to monitor the runtime status of remote logger processes.
        _exist_ok: Determines how the class handles already existing shared memory buffer errors.

        Notes:
            To improve runtime efficiency, the method processes all log sources in-parallel, using multithreading.
            The exact number of parallel threads used by the method depends on the number of available CPU cores. This
            number can be further adjusting by modifying the max_workers argument.

            This method requires all data from the same source to be loaded into RAM before it is added to the .npz
            archive. While this should not be a problem for most use cases, it may lead to out-of-memory errors. To
            avoid this, the method uses memory-mapping by default, to reduce the RAM requirements. If your machine
            has sufficient RAM, disable this by setting the memory_mapping argument to False.

        Args:
            remove_sources: Determines whether to remove the individual .npy files after they have been consolidated
                into .npz archives. The method ensures that all compressed entries match the original entries before
                deleting source files, so this option is safe for all use cases.
            memory_mapping: Determines whether the method uses memory-mapping (disk) to stage the data before
                compression or loads all data into RAM. Disabling this option makes the method considerably faster, but
                may lead to out-of-memory errors in certain use cases. Note, due to collisions with Windows not
                releasing memory-mapped files, this argument does not do anything on Windows.
            verbose: Determines whether to print compression progress to terminal. Due to a generally fast compression
                time, this option is generally not needed for most runtimes.
            compress: Determines whether to compress the output .npz archive file for each source. While the intention
                behind this method is to compress archive data, it is possible to use the method to just aggregate the
                data into .npz files without compression. This processing mode is usually desirable for runtimes that
                need to minimize the time spent on processing the data.
            verify_integrity: Determines whether to verify the integrity of compressed data against the original log
                entries before removing sources. While it is highly unlikely that compression alters the data, it is
                recommended to have this option enabled to ensure data integrity.
            max_workers: Determines the number of threads use to process logs entries from different sources
                in-parallel. If set to None, the method uses the number of CPU cores - 4 threads.
