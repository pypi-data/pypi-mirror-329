## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, track issues and feature requests, and accept pull requests. Here's our development workflow:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Set up your development environment:
   ```bash
   # Create a virtual environment
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
   
   # Install development dependencies
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```
3. Write your code and add tests:
   - Add unit tests for new features
4. Ensure code quality:
   - Run tests: `pytest`
   - Check code style: `ruff check .`
5. Update documentation:
   - Add docstrings (Google format)
   - Update API documentation if needed
   - Include examples in docstrings if necessary
6. Submit your pull request

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your PR includes:
   - A clear description of the changes
   - Any updates to documentation
   - New or updated tests
   - Example usage if applicable
2. Link any related issues in the PR description
3. The PR will be reviewed by maintainers who may request changes
4. Once approved, your PR will be merged

## Code Style and Standards

We follow scientific Python coding standards to maintain consistency:
