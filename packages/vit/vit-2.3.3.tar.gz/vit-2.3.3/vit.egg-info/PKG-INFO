## Installation

Follow the directions in [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/vit-project/vit/blob/2.x/INSTALL.md)

## Quick start

Run ```vit --help``` from the command line for basic usage instructions.

Run ```vit``` from the command line to start VIT with default config, report, and filters.

While VIT is running, type ```:help``` followed by enter to review basic command/navigation actions.

#### Recommendations:

 * VIT will suggest to install a default user config file if none exists -- it's fully commented with all configuration options, check it out.
 * Do ```vit --help``` *(know the vit command line arguments)*
 * Do ```:help``` in vit *(look over the "commands")*
 * Use an xterm terminal *(for full color support)*
 * For suggestions on further tweaks, see [CUSTOMIZE.md](https://github.com/vit-project/vit/blob/2.x/CUSTOMIZE.md)
 * VIT handles task coloring differently than Taskwarrior, see [COLOR.md](https://github.com/vit-project/vit/blob/2.x/COLOR.md) for more details
