## **What is Preswald?**

Preswald is a full-stack platform for building, deploying, and managing interactive data applications. It combines ingestion, storage, transformation, and visualization into one lightweight and powerful SDK. Whether you're prototyping internal tools or deploying production-grade apps, Preswald reduces complexity and cost without compromising flexibility.

- Code-First Simplicity. Minimal Python and SQL for powerful apps
- End-to-End Coverage. Handle ingestion, ETL, and visualization in one platform
- Efficient by Design. Avoid the sprawling complexity of the modern data stack while keeping what works.
- Connect to CSV, JSON, Parquet, or SQL databases in seconds.
- Fully Customizable Themes. Your app, your brand‚Äîjust tweak images and names in `preswald.toml`.
- Go live on your machine with a single command.

# **üöÄ Getting Started**

## **Installation**

First, install Preswald using pip. https://pypi.org/project/preswald/

```bash
pip install preswald
```

## **üë©‚Äçüíª Quick Start**

### **1. Initialize a New Project**

Start your journey with Preswald by initializing a new project:

```bash
preswald init my_project
cd my_project
```

This will create a folder called `my_project` with all the basics you need:

- `hello.py`: Your first Preswald app.
- `preswald.toml`: Customize your app‚Äôs settings and style.
- `secrets.toml`: Keep your API keys and sensitive information safe.
- `.gitignore`: Preconfigured to keep `secrets.toml` out of your Git repository.

### **2. Write Your First App**

Time to make something magical! Open up `hello.py` and write:

```python
from preswald import text, connect, get_df, view
import pandas as pd

# Render Markdown content
text("# Welcome to Preswald")

# Connect to a CSV source
connect()
df = get_df("sample_data")

# Display the data as a table
view(df)
```

### **3. Run Your App**

Now the fun part‚Äîsee it in action! Run your app locally with:

```bash
preswald run hello.py
```

This command launches a development server, and Preswald will let you know where your app is hosted. Typically, it‚Äôs here:

```
üåê App running at: http://localhost:8501
```

Open your browser, and voil√†‚Äîyour first Preswald app is live!

### **4. Deploy Your App to the Cloud**

Once you've built and tested your app locally, deploying it to the cloud is just as simple. Preswald integrates with **Google Cloud Run**, allowing you to host your app in a scalable, serverless environment with just one command.

To deploy your app, set up Google Cloud credentials and a project. Then, run:

```bash
preswald deploy hello.py --project <your-gcp-project>
```

Once deployed, you‚Äôll see a URL where your app is live, for example:

```
üåê App deployed at: https://your-app-name-abc123.run.app
```

## **üí° Examples**

### **Example 1: Hello World**

```python
from preswald import text

text("# Hello, World!")
```

### **Example 2: Interactive Dashboard**

```python
from preswald import text, slider, connect, get_df, view
import pandas as pd


text("# Interactive Dashboard")
connect() # load in sources from preswald.toml
slider_value = slider("Rows to Display", min_val=10, max_val=100, step=10, default=50)

df = get_df("sample_data") # name of csv source in preswald.toml
view(df, limit=slider_value)
```

## **üîß Configuration**

Preswald uses `preswald.toml` for project settings and theming. It‚Äôs straightforward, and it makes your app look polished.

### **Sample `preswald.toml`:**

```
[project]
title = "Preswald Project"
version = "0.1.0"
port = 8501

[branding]
name = "Preswald Project"
logo = "images/logo.png"
favicon = "images/favicon.ico"
primaryColor = "#4CAF50"

[logging]
level = "INFO" # Options: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
format = "%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s"
```
