This module is used to apply exploratory data analysis to your dataset.

This module provides functions for analyzing time series data by different
dimensions such as stores and products. It helps in understanding patterns,
distributions, and key statistics in your data.

Functions:
    summarize_by_store: Aggregates and analyzes data at the store level
    summarize_by_product: Aggregates and analyzes data at the product level

    Generate summary statistics grouped by store.

    Args:
        df (pd.DataFrame): Input DataFrame containing store data.
            Must include store identifiers and metrics to be summarized.

    Returns:
        pd.DataFrame: Summary statistics for each store, including:
