A Python wrapper for GGWave, a data-over-sound communication library.

This Python library is built on top of the existing **Python bindings** from the official 
[GGWave repository](https://github.com/ggerganov/ggwave/tree/master). 
However, the original bindings are minimal and lack usability features, 
so this wrapper provides a more **user-friendly** API with **enum support, 
streamlined encoding/decoding, and optional PyAudio integration**.

## üìå Features
- Encode and decode messages using sound waves.
- Support for multiple transmission protocols.
- Optional real-time audio transmission and reception via PyAudio.

## üöÄ Installation

### Basic installation
```sh
pip install ggwave_python
```

### With audio support (PyAudio)
```sh
pip install ggwave_python[audio]
```

## üîß Usage

### Encoding and decoding messages
```python
from ggwave_python import GGWave, ProtocolId

gg = GGWave()
try:
    waveform = gg.encode("Hello, world!", ProtocolId.AUDIBLE_FAST, volume=20)
    decoded = gg.decode(waveform)
    print(decoded.decode("utf-8"))  # "Hello, world!"
finally:
    gg.free()
```

### Real-time audio transmission (requires PyAudio)
```python
from ggwave_python import GGWave, ProtocolId, waveform_utils

gg = GGWave()
try:
    waveform = gg.encode("Test message", ProtocolId.AUDIBLE_FAST, volume=20)
    waveform_utils.play_waveform(waveform)
finally:
    gg.free()
```

### Real-time audio reception
```python
from ggwave_python import GGWave, waveform_utils

gg = GGWave()
try:
    for message in waveform_utils.listen():
        print("Received:", message.decode("utf-8"))
finally:
    gg.free()
```

### WAV Tools

On how to convert waveforms into WAV-format and back, please see [WAV Example](examples/wav_example.py).

### More examples

For more examples please see [Examples](examples/).


## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Details
GGWave transmits data using **frequency-shift keying (FSK)**, allowing devices to communicate via sound. 
The transmission rate is **8-16 bytes/sec**, depending on the selected protocol. 


## üõ†Ô∏è Development and Code Formatting

This project follows **strict code style and formatting rules**, enforced via `pre-commit` hooks.  
We use the following tools:

- **[Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff)** ‚Üí Linter, import sorting, and lightweight formatter.
- **[Black](https://github.com/psf/black)** ‚Üí Code auto-formatter.
- **[Pytest](https://pytest.org/)** ‚Üí For unit testing.

### **üîß Setting Up the Development Environment**
To ensure a consistent environment, **use `poetry shell`** instead of installing packages globally.

```sh
poetry shell  # Activate the virtual environment
make init     # Install all dependencies
```

---

### **‚úÖ Linting and Formatting**
Our project **requires clean, formatted code**. Use `make check` to validate your code.

#### **Check code style (without modifying files)**
```sh
make check
```

#### **Fix code style issues automatically**
```sh
make fix
```

---

### **üõ† Pre-Commit Hooks (Mandatory)**
This project **requires** `pre-commit` hooks to ensure formatting and linting before commits.  
You **must** install the pre-commit hook before making changes.

#### **Install pre-commit hook**
```sh
pre-commit install
```

#### **Run pre-commit manually on all files**
```sh
make pre-commit
```

#### **Remove pre-commit hooks (if needed)**
```sh
pre-commit uninstall
```

---

## **üß™ Running Tests**
Tests are managed with `pytest`.  

#### **Run all tests**
```sh
make tests
```

#### **Run a specific test**
```sh
pytest tests/test_ggwave.py -k test_encode_decode
```

---

## **üìú Makefile for Development Workflow**
All development tasks can be executed via `make` commands.

| Command            | Description                                           |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `make init`       | Install dependencies inside the virtual environment   |
| `make check`      | Run Ruff & Black in **check mode** (without changes)  |
| `make fix`        | Auto-fix code style issues with Black & Ruff          |
| `make tests`      | Run all tests with Pytest                             |
| `make build`      | Build the package using Poetry                        |
| `make pre-commit` | Run all pre-commit hooks manually                     |
| `make help`       | Show all available `make` commands                    |

Now your development workflow is **fully automated**! üöÄ
