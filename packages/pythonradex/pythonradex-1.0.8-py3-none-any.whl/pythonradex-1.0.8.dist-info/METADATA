Description-Content-Type: text/plain

pythonradex solves the 1D non-LTE radiative transfer for a homogeneous medium. It is a tool to quickly estimate the radiation from an astrophysical gas. It also provides a convenient function to read data files from the LAMDA database. pythonradex is a python re-implementation of the RADEX code, with additional functionality not included in RADEX (treatment of overlapping lines, treatment of dust continuum, output of spectra,...)
