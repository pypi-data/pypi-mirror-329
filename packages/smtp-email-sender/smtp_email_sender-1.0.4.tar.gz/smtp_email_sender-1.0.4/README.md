## Usage

### 1. Sending a Simple Email

Below is a basic example of sending a plain text email:

```python
from smtp_email_sender import EmailSender, email_text

# Initialize the EmailSender with your SMTP credentials.
sender = EmailSender(
    sender="your_email@example.com",
    password="your_password",
    smtp_server="smtp.example.com",
    smtp_port=587,
    use_tls=True,
    debug=True  # Set to False to actually send the email.
)

# Create and send the email message.
sender.create_message(
    receiver="recipient@example.com",
    subject="Hello from SMTP-Email-Sender"
).attach(
    email_text("This is a test email sent using SMTP-Email-Sender!", "plain")
).sendmail()

# Finalize and close the SMTP connection.
sender.finish()
```

### 2. Sending Emails Using a Template

Send personalized emails to multiple recipients with dynamic content:

```python
from smtp_email_sender import EmailSender

# Initialize the EmailSender.
sender = EmailSender(
    sender="your_email@example.com",
    password="your_password",
    smtp_server="smtp.example.com",
    smtp_port=587,
    use_tls=True,
    debug=True  # Toggle debug mode as needed.
)

# Define your email template with placeholders.
template = "Hi {name},\n\nWe are excited to invite you to {event}! See you there."

# Define the recipient data.
mails = ["alice@example.com", "bob@example.com"]
subjects = ["Invitation to Python Meetup", "Invitation to Python Meetup"]
placeholders = [
    {"name": "Alice", "event": "the Python Meetup"},
    {"name": "Bob", "event": "the Python Meetup"}
]

# Optionally, define CC lists and file attachments (here, none).

# Send the templated emails.
sender.sendmail_from_template(
    template=template,
    mails=mails,
    subjects=subjects,
    text_type="plain",
    placeholders=placeholders
)

# Finalize the process.
sender.finish()
```

### 3. Attaching Files

Attach files to your email with proper encoding:

```python
from smtp_email_sender import EmailSender, email_file, email_text

# Initialize the EmailSender.
sender = EmailSender(
    sender="your_email@example.com",
    password="your_password",
    smtp_server="smtp.example.com",
    smtp_port=587,
    use_tls=True,
    debug=True
)

# Create a message and attach both text content and a file.
sender.create_message("recipient@example.com", "Monthly Report") \
      .attach(email_text("Please find the monthly report attached.", "plain")) \
      .attach(email_file("path/to/report.pdf", "Monthly_Report.pdf")) \
      .sendmail()

# Close the connection.
sender.finish()
```

### 4. Using SMTP-Email-Sender with Gmail

#### Steps to Use Gmail with SMTP-Email-Sender:

1. **Enable 2-Step Verification:**  
   Sign in to your Google account and enable 2-Step Verification.

2. **Generate an App Password:**  
   After enabling 2-Step Verification, go to the [App Passwords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords) section. Select the app (e.g., "Mail") and device (e.g., "Other" and name it "SMTP-Email-Sender") and generate an app password. Save this password securely.

3. **Update Your Code:**  
   Use your full Gmail address as the sender and the generated app password in your code. Here's an example:

```python
from smtp_email_sender import EmailSender, email_text

# Replace these values with your Gmail details.
gmail_address = "your_gmail@gmail.com"
app_password = "your_generated_app_password"

# Initialize the EmailSender using Gmail's SMTP server.
sender = EmailSender(
    sender=gmail_address,
    password=app_password,
    smtp_server="smtp.gmail.com",
    smtp_port=587,
    use_tls=True,
    debug=True  # Set to False to send the email for real.
)

# Create and send the email message.
sender.create_message(
    receiver="recipient@example.com",
    subject="Hello from SMTP-Email-Sender via Gmail"
).attach(
    email_text("This email was sent using Gmail's SMTP server and an App Password.", "plain")
).sendmail()

# Finalize and close the SMTP connection.
sender.finish()
```

Follow these steps to securely send emails via Gmail using SMTP-Email-Sender.

## Logging & Debugging

SMTP-Email-Sender uses Python's built-in `logging` module to provide detailed feedback. When in debug mode (`debug=True`), the module logs the recipients, email content, and any errors without actually sending emailsâ€”ideal for development and testing.

Check your console or log files to see these detailed messages, which can help diagnose issues with SMTP connection, authentication, or file attachments.
