# code-zipper

**code-zipper** is a command-line tool designed to copy multiple files and
directories directly to your clipboard.
Perfect for efficiently pasting code or text into ChatGPT!

---

## Features

- **Multiple Input Support:** Accepts files, directories, or glob patterns.
- **Structured Output:** Adds line numbers, file names, and sizes.
- **Clipboard Integration:** Aggregates content for instant pasting.
- **Minimal Dependencies:** Only uses two external libraries.

---

## Installation

Install via pip:

```bash
pip install code-zipper
```

Ensure Python and pip are installed on your system.
The tool is tested and supported for Python 3.10 and above.

---

## Usage

Once installed, run `code-zipper` from the command line
with desired paths or patterns:

```bash
code-zipper <file1> <folder2> <glob-pattern3>
```

Note that if you are passing just a folder, the tool with recursively
copy all `*.py` files within that directory.
This is handy if you want to copy all Python files in a project
like `code-zipper src`.

**Example:**

```bash
code-zipper src *.md tests/util/*.py
```

**Explanation:**
- `src` Copies every `*.py` file from the “src” folder (and any subfolders).
- `*.md` Matches all files ending with `.md` in the current directory.
- `tests/util/*.py` Matches only the `.py` files immediately  within the `tests/util` directory (subdirectories are not included).

For copying files from nested folders, use the folder name without a glob pattern.

**How It Works:**

1. **Input:** Provide a list of file paths, directories, or glob patterns.
2. **Processing:** Reads each file, concatenating contents while maintaining structure.
3. **Output:** Copies the combined result to your clipboard, ready for pasting.
