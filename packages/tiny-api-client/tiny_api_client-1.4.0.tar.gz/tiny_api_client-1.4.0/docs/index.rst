🐝 Tiny API Client
==================

The short and sweet way to create an API client
-----------------------------------------------


::

        from tiny_api_client import api_client, get

        @api_client("https://example.org/api/v{version}", timeout=10)
        class MyClient:
            @get("/posts/{post_id}", version=2)
            def get_posts(self, response):
                return response

        >>> client = MyClient()
        >>> client.get_posts() # route parameters are optional


Tiny API Client is a wrapper for `requests` that enables you to succintly write API clients
without much effort. Calls on each instance of a client class will share a `requests.Session`
with cookie preservation and improved performance due to request pooling.

To get started, see the :ref:`basics` first.

To learn how to test your own API clients, see the :doc:`testing`.

To learn how to use the mypy integration, see the :doc:`typing` section.
