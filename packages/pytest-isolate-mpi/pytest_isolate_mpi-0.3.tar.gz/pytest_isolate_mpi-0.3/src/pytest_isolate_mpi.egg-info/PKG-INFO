MPI-Parallel, Crash-Safe Tests for Pytest
=========================================

``pytest-isolate-mpi`` is a plugin for `Pytest`_ to enable the test of
MPI-parallel Python software. MPI-parallel tests are executed in forked
MPI jobs with the help of `mpirun`_ to isolate the tests from each
other. Thus, a crash in test only aborts the test, not the whole test
suite. Similarly, deadlocks can be treated with timeouts for tests to
prevent a test suite from never being able to finish::

    import pytest
    
    
    @pytest.mark.mpi(ranks=2, timeout=10, unit="s")
    def test_with_mpi(mpi_ranks):
        assert True  # replace with actual, MPI-parallel test code
