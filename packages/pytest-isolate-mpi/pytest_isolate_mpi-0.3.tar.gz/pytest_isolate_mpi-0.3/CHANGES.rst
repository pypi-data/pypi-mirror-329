  unit for all MPI-parallel tests have been added. (`#20`_)

Version 0.2
-----------

- An option to customize the command used to launch Pytest in MPI has
  been added. This enables test runs on HPC environments in which
  individual tests are scheduled as jobs via the HPC batch system.
  (`#10`_)

- An unhandled edge case when using a session-scoped fixture in
  non-parametrized tests was fixed. (`#14`_)

- Session-scoped fixtures are now only cached within the MPI-parallel
  Pytest sub sessions. This allows the use of session-scoped fixtures
  which cannot be pickled for non-MPI tests.

- Most of Pytest's CLI options are now passed the MPI-parallel
  sub sessions. (`#10`_)
