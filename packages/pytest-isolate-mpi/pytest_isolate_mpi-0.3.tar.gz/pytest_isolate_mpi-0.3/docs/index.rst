MPI-Parallel, Crash-Safe Tests for Pytest
=========================================

``pytest-isolate-mpi`` is a plugin for `Pytest`_ to enable the test of
MPI-parallel Python software. MPI-parallel tests are executed in forked
MPI jobs with the help of `mpirun`_ to isolate the tests from each
other. Thus, a crash in test only aborts the test, not the whole test
suite. Similarly, deadlocks can be treated with timeouts for tests to
prevent a test suite from never being able to finish.
