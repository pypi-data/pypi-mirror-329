# goonlang

Programming lnaguage made in python with `lark`

There's only a few functions right now, you can assign variables, add, subtract, print, and I think a few others.

## Installation

Just run `pip install goonlang`!

## Execution

Run `goonlang <filename>`, if that doesn't work, then try `py(thon3) -m goonlang <filename>`
