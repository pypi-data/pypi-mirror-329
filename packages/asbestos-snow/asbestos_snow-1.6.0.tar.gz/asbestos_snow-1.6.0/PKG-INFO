# asbestos-snow

This is the old location of the `asbestos` project for mocking SnowflakeDB calls in your application. Installing this stub will install the current version of `asbestos`, but you should update your requirements to install `asbestos` instead of `asbestos-snow`.

The new home of the project is here: https://pypi.org/project/asbestos/

## Note for developers

This directory is a self-contained stub package that is automatically released when a new version of `asbestos` is released. Do not touch anything in here and do not delete this directory.
