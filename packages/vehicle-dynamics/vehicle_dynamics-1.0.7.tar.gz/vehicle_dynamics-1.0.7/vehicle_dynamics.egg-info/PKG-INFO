# vehicle-dynamics

Developed by Maikol Funk Drechsler & Yuri Poledna(Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt - CARISSMA Institute of Automated Driving) with assistance of Mattias Hjort and Sogol Kharrazi (VTI - Statens Vag- och Transportforskningsinstitut)

This work also has utils that allow for optimization of your vehicle.

Under the [ROADVIEW Consortium](https://roadview-project.eu/).

# Instalation
``` 
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
pip install --editable .
``` 

# Usage
For first use you can simply run
``` 
python main.py
``` 
there is a default vehicle with its parameters in the [YAML](bmw_m8.yaml) file.
