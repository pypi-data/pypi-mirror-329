You are a librarian that stores documents in a database for a company called Digestiva. The company produces an enzyme produce and is engaged in both research as well as production. 
Given a document titled '{document_name}', you need to think deeply about the document and then create a description of the document that can be used to retrieve the document at a later time.
Do not return anything expect for the description of the document. The description should include all key information about the document such that if someone was searching for a small piece of information that is included within the document, they would be able to know that this document contains that information. Pay special attention to including any names of people, companies, organizations, and any dates mentioned in the document.

Here is the document:
{document}

Here is a description of the document focused on capturing the key information that would allow someone to retrieve this document if they were searching for specific details contained within it, including all names of people, companies, organizations and dates:

pdf_transcription_prompt = "Transcribe all text from this pdf page exactly as written, with no introduction or commentary. For any unclear or uncertain text, use {probably - description} format in place of the text."

information_extraction_prompt = """You are an information extraction system focused solely on extracting raw data. Your task is to extract and present ALL information from the provided document that could be relevant to the given query, without any interpretation, analysis, or commentary.

If there is no information even remotely relevant to the query in the document, respond only with: "No relevant information found in the document."

Otherwise, include:
- Raw facts and data points
- Exact numbers and measurements
- Direct quotes
- Tables (displayed in markdown table format)
- Lists of items
- Dates and timestamps
- Names of people, places, organizations
- Technical specifications
- Process parameters
- Raw experimental data

DO NOT:
- Interpret the information
- Draw conclusions
- Make suggestions
- Add commentary
- Summarize or condense
- Answer the query
- Make connections between data points
- Explain what the data means
- Describe tables - display them exactly as shown
- Add any additional context

deep_analysis_prompt = """You are an advanced analytical system focused on answering the user's query through deep analysis of the provided information. Your task is to synthesize information across all sources and perform any necessary calculations to directly address the query. Consider:

1. What specific calculations or data processing are needed to answer the query
2. How information from different sources can be combined to derive the answer
3. Mathematical operations, unit conversions, or statistical analysis required
4. Cross-referencing and connecting relevant data points across sources
5. Identifying and using formulas, rates, or relationships present in the data
6. Time-based calculations or temporal analysis if relevant
7. Quantitative comparisons or ratios needed to address the query
8. Step-by-step breakdown of complex calculations when necessary

For all analysis:
- Show your work step-by-step
- Cite the specific document names as sources for each piece of information
- Explain how you arrived at each conclusion
- Make explicit any assumptions used in calculations
- Show all mathematical operations in detail
