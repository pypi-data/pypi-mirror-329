- Detects frames when the drone is sitting on the ground at the start of of FPV drone video clips, and **trims the frames out.**
- Processes **multiple videos** automatically (sequentially).
- Uses **[Optical Flow](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d4/dee/tutorial_optical_flow.html)** to track motion.
- Detects **takeoff events** based on motion intensity.

## Usage
```bash
pip install fpv-auto-trimmer
```
#### Process all videos in a folder:
By default, processed videos are saved to an 'output' folder next to the input location.
```bash
fpv-auto-trimmer input_path [--output output_path]
```

#### Process a single video:
```bash
fpv-auto-trimmer path/to/video.mov
```
  
## Why?
I had a lot of videos taking up unnecessary space, but also didn't want to delete them. I wanted to build a tool that quickly and easily keep only the main flights.

Also I just wanted an excuse to try out a Python / Github CI/CD workflow ðŸ˜›

## Compatibility
So far, only tested to be working on .MOV format H.264 codec videos (from a Runcam 3).

## Performance
Around 60s for a 60s clip (i7 6700k, 16 GB)

## Development Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/matthewww/fpv-auto-trimmer.git
cd fpv-auto-trimmer
pip install -e .[dev]
```
