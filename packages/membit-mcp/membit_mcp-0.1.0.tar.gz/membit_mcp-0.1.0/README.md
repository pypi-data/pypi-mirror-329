## Introduction

Membit MCP Server is designed to empower AI agents with timely social context. It translates Membit's REST endpoints into MCP tools, allowing your AI to:

- **üîç Discover Trends:** Search for and retrieve clusters of social discussions.
- **üï≥Ô∏è Dive Deeper:** Fetch detailed posts and metadata for specific clusters.
- **üß† Extract Insights:** Look up raw posts related to any keyword.

By integrating these capabilities, your AI can better understand and respond to rapidly evolving social narratives.

---

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Data:** Pull live data from Membit's continuously updated API.
- **MCP Compatibility:** Seamlessly integrates with any client that supports the Model Context Protocol.
- **Simplicity & Flexibility:** A lightweight Python server that uses FastMCP for rapid development.
- **Clear Error Handling:** Provides meaningful error feedback for smooth debugging.

---

## Requirements

Make sure your system includes:

- A valid [Membit API token](https://membit.ai/api-keys) (get one by registering on Membit)
- Python 3.10 or later (check with `python --version`)
- An MCP-capable client (e.g., [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) or [Cursor](https://cursor.sh))
- Git (if you plan to clone the repository)

## Installation Guide

### PyPI Package

If available on PyPI, you can install directly:

```bash
pip install membit-mcp
```

### Clone from Git

Alternatively, to work from the source:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/membit-ai/membit-mcp.git
   cd membit-mcp
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Launch the server:
   ```bash
   python membit_mcp.py
   ```

---

## Client Configuration

### Using Cursor

1. Open Cursor‚Äôs settings.
2. Navigate to **Features > MCP Servers**.
3. Click **"+ Add New MCP Server"**.
4. Enter:
   - **Name:** `membit-mcp`
   - **Type:** `command`
   - **Command:**
     ```bash
     env MEMBIT_API_TOKEN=your-api-token python membit_mcp.py
     ```
     Replace `your-api-token` with your actual Membit API token.

### Using Claude Desktop

For Claude Desktop, create or modify the configuration file:

- **macOS:** `$HOME/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

Insert the following JSON snippet (substitute your API token):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "membit-mcp": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["membit_mcp.py"],
      "env": {
        "MEMBIT_API_TOKEN": "your-api-token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## How It Works

The server uses the Model Context Protocol to expose three primary tools:

- **membit-clusters-search:**  
  Sends a GET request to `https://api.membit.com/clusters/search` with a query string and limit.
- **membit-clusters-info:**  
  Fetches details from `https://api.membit.com/clusters/info` using a cluster label.
- **membit-posts-search:**  
  Searches for raw social posts by keyword via `https://api.membit.com/posts/search`.

Each tool is accessible via MCP, and responses are formatted as human-readable JSON for easy integration.

## Example Interactions

- **Find Trending Topics:**  
  _Query:_ ‚Äúmembit-clusters-search for ‚Äòcryptocurrency‚Äô‚Äù  
  _Response:_ A list of trending clusters discussing cryptocurrency.

- **Get Cluster Details:**  
  _Query:_ ‚Äúmembit-clusters-info for cluster labeled ‚Äòcrypto-trends‚Äô‚Äù  
  _Response:_ Detailed posts and metadata for that cluster.

- **Search for Specific Posts:**  
  _Query:_ ‚Äúmembit-posts-search for posts with ‚Äòblockchain‚Äô‚Äù  
  _Response:_ Raw social post data containing the keyword ‚Äúblockchain.‚Äù

These interactions allow your AI agent to draw on live social data in real time.
