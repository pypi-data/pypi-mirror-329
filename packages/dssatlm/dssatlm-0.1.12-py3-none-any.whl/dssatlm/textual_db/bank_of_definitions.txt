Yield at harvest maturity (kg [dm]/ha): the total weight of a crop harvested per hectare, in kilograms of dry matter. It represents the portion of the crop that remains after all water content has been removed, providing a consistent basis for comparing yields across different conditions.
Harvested yield (kg [dm]/ha): the total weight of a crop harvested per hectare, in kilograms of dry matter (dm). It represents the portion of the crop that remains after all water content has been removed, providing a consistent basis for comparing yields across different conditions.
Harvest index at maturity: the ratio between the harvest's dry weight and the crop biomass's total dry weight (including the harvest). It is the proportion of the above-ground biomass (in the case of cereals) that is found in the grain, i.e., a harvest index of 33 percent, results in a ratio of 2 kg straw:1 kg grain (FAO, 2022)
