## Introduction

Naima Lab focuses on creating and optimizing language models for various natural language processing tasks. Our goal is to provide efficient and effective tools for researchers and developers.

## Installation

To install the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/naima-lab.git

    ```
3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To fine-tune a language model using Naima Lab, use the following command:
```bash
naima-lab nlp llm_sft_instruct --config-file path/to/config.yml --dataset-path path/to/dataset.json
```
Replace `path/to/config.yml` and `path/to/dataset.json` with the appropriate paths to your configuration file and dataset.
