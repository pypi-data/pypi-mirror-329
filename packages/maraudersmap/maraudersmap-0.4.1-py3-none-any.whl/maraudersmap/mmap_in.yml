# rules about concerned sources ---------
path : /path/to/sources/  #the common path to sources
context : null #by default, same as path to sources
mandatory_patterns: null  # by default all path taken. If provided e.g. "*src*","*sources*", all paths must match one of these patterns
forbidden_patterns: null  # by default all path taken. If provided e.g. "*autogen*","*test*", any path matching one of these patterns is excluded
