## Q & A

- How to use Komga?
See [Rainie's article](https://home.gamer.com.tw/artwork.php?sn=5659465).

- Why aren't the tags for CBZ-files in Komga updated?
When you first run `H2HDB`, it generates CBZ-files. These CBZ-files are not immediately visible in Komga's library. To update them, you have two options: you can either click the 'scan library files' button in Komga, or you can run `H2HDB` twice. The first run scans the library, and the second run updates the tags.
