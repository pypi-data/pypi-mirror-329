# Background

This feature is a combination of several ideas:

*   TODO: TODO_96_01_13_29: multiple bootstrap stages to instantiate configs.

*   Using Python lang as bootstrap process entry point.

*   Using (mostly) template FS_69_15_45_21 template instantiator.

    This is instead of making copies or symlinks of files from deployed packages. 

There is existing FS_85_33_46_53 process to `bootstrap_env` which will likely be replaced (obsoleted) by this feature.
