# LINTER CONFIGURATION & GUIDELINES 
# There is no rule that says linter configurations MUST be put in the pyproject.toml
# This is partially because not all tools support it.  That said with the move to ruff,
# this file felt like the logical place to keep any documentations regarding how or why
# configurations are the way they are.

# The general rule:
# "Linters should help, not hinder."
# If the inclination on a rule is to add a whole bunch of exceptions in various places,
# perhaps that rule should not be run regularly.
