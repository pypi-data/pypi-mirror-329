# cli.py

## Description

`cli.py` is a simple command-line tool written in Python that calculates the sum of integers from 1 to a specified upper limit `n`. It leverages the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to efficiently compute the result.

## Installation

To use `cli.py`, ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once Python is installed, you can run the script directly if it has executable permissions or invoke it using Python:

```bash
chmod +x cli.py
./cli.py <n>
```

Alternatively:

```bash
python3 cli.py <n>
```

## Usage

The script accepts one argument, which is the upper limit integer `n`.

### Command-Line Arguments

- `n`: The upper limit integer (must be a positive integer).

### Example

To calculate the sum of integers from 1 to 10:

```bash
./cli.py 10
```

Output:
```
The sum of integers from 1 to 10 is: 55
```

### Error Handling

If the input is not a positive integer, the script will display an error message:

```bash
./cli.py -5
```

Output:
```
Error: Input must be a positive integer.
```
