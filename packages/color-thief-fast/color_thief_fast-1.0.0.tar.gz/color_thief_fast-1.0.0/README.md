### Color Thief Fast

This project is dedicated to extracting image theme colors. During the development process, we referred to
[Color Thief](https://github.com/fengsp/color-thief-py/). and greatly improved the processing speed by introducing the
numpy library.

1. High performance processing
   With the powerful array computing power of numpy, the speed has been increased by more than 5 times, and compared to
   traditional methods, the performance has been significantly optimized.
2. Custom pixel processing
   Support users to customize pixel processing according to their own needs, meeting diverse image processing
   requirements
