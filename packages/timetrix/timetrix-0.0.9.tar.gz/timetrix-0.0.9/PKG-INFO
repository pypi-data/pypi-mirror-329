# TimeMashine

The TimeMachine class provides methods that help in displaying time or time periods in a static format when needed.

- day(): This method, when called, returns the current day of the month as an integer.

- month(): This method, when called, returns the current month as an integer.

- year(): This method, when called, returns the current year as an integer.

- month_name(): This method, when called, returns the current name of month as string.

- hour(): This method, when called, returns the current hour as an integer.

- minutes(): This method, when called, returns the current minutes as an integer.

- seconds(): This method, when called, returns the current seconds as an integer.

- clock(): This method retrieves the current time from the stored date and formats it 
as a string representing the time in hours, minutes, and seconds (HH:MM:SS). The formatted time is then 
printed on the same line, updating the displayed time without moving to a new line.
