An open-source Python library for web scraping tasks. Includes support for both text and image scraping.

## Changes in 0.1.5:
- Added new params to both `scrape_images` and `scrape_text` to allow for following child links, and setting a maximum allowed followed child links.
- Added a `json` export format for text scraping, with improvements to exporting.

> [!TIP]
> We recommend disabling `remove_duplicates` on large sites, to allow for faster text scraping (this can improve speed by 4x). It also may not work well with `follow_child_links` enabled, as it may remove similar content from scraped child links.

## Changes in 0.1.4:
- Added new parameters to `scrape_text` to allow automatic removal of duplicates or similar text, and another to specify the type of textual content to scrape (`text`, `content`, `unseen`, `links`).

## Changes in 0.1.3:
- Added support for handling of different types of images on websites. Also now checks for invalid images, with added error handling.

## Changes in 0.1.2

Changes in version 0.1.2:
- `min` and `max` width and height parameters can now be specified when working with image scraping, allowing you to quickly exclude smaller resolution images, or images that are extremely large and take up too much space.
- PyWebScrapr now uses BeautifulSoup4's `SoupStrainer`, making extracting content from webpages much faster.

```bash
