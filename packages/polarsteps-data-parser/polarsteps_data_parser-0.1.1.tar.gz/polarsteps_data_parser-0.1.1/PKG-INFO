# Polarsteps Data Parser

Tool designed to parse and extract data from the travel tracking app [Polarsteps](https://www.polarsteps.com/) data export. This tool serves two primary purposes:

1. **Data backup**: The data export does not support viewing your data in any useful way. To preserve the data (who knows if Polarsteps still exists in 20 years), the tool combines the data and generates a PDF document.
2. **Data analysis & visualization**: The parsed data can also be leveraged for in-depth analysis, enabling users to gain insights into their travel patterns, destinations visited, duration of stays, distances traveled, and more. This opens up possibilities for statistical analysis, trend identification, and visualization of the trip data.

## Getting started

### Installation
To set up the project, ensure you have Python 3.11+ installed.

Install from PyPI using pip:
```shell
pip install polarsteps-data-parser
```

### Usage
To get the following output, run `polarsteps-data-parser --help`.

```shell
Usage: polarsteps-data-parser [OPTIONS] INPUT_FOLDER

  Parse the data from a Polarsteps trip export.

  INPUT_FOLDER should contain the Polarsteps data export of one (!) trip. Make
  sure the folder contains a `trip.json` and `locations.json`.

Options:
  --output TEXT           Output PDF file name  [default: Trip report.pdf]
  --enrich-with-comments  Whether to enrich the trip with comments or not.
  --help                  Show this message and exit.
```

For example, to load and analyse a trip with the data located in the `./data/trip1` folder and enrich the trip with comments, use the following command:

```shell
polarsteps-data-parser ./data/trip1 --enrich-with-comments
```
