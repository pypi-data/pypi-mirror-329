    """
    Exception raised when a USB endpoint stalls.

    Stalling is an endpoint's way to indicate an error has occurred
    such as an invalid packet that has been received.

    A stalled endpoint is halted and must be reactivated by
    clearing the halt using :meth:`Device.clear_halt`.
    The exception is control endpoint 0, which clears the halt condition automatically.
