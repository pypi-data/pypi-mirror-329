class Device:
    """
    USB device.

    This class provides the functions to query details about a USB device
    and to communicate with it.

    In order to make control requests and transfer data, the device must be
    opened and an interface must be claimed. In the open state, the current
    process has exclusive access to the claimed interfaces.

    Information about the device is always available, without opening
    the device and even after it has been unplugged.

    Instances of this class are created by the global device registry
    when a USB device is plugged in and when the registry starts. They are
    active until the USB device is unplugged. Thereafter, information can still
    be queried but all communication related functions no longer work.
