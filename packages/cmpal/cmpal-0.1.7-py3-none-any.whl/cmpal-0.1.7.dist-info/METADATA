# commit-pal ⚡️

A CLI AI assistant that helps you write commit messages at the speed of light using locally run LLMs.

## Quick Start

### Install and setup commit-pal

Install the latest version of `commit-pal` from PyPI:

```bash
pip install commit-pal
```

```bash
cm --setup # Configure the style of the commit messages
```

### Run LLM locally with Ollama

- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/download) should be installed and running
- Pull and run a model to use with the library: `ollama run <model>` e.g. `ollama run qwen2.5-coder:7b`
  - See [Ollama.com](https://ollama.com/search) for more information on the models available.
  - We have seen the best performance with [qwen2.5-coder:7b](https://ollama.com/library/qwen2.5-coder:7b) model so far.

By default, Ollama will run on `localhost:11434`.

### Generate commit message

After staging your changes, run the following command to generate a commit message:

```bash
cm
```

The proposed commit message will be displayed in the terminal for you to review and confirm

## Development Setup (Only for developers who wish to contribute to the project)
