# TinySOM
The `tinysom` package is yet another Self-Organising Maps (SOM) library, with the following features:

- hexagonal and rectangular grid topologies
- Euclidean and cosine similarities
- Gaussian, exponential, linear and bubble neighbourhoods
- sub-classes for unsupervised clustering and supervised classification
- 2d visualisation of fitted grid
- unit dropout regularisation

Planned improvements:
- feature dropout regularisation
- parallelisation
- improve unsupervised clustering
