class EmailCodeVerifier:
	'''
	This class is used to verify code sent to emails 

	The codes are saved in a file .

	Attributes
	----------
	name:str
		A name you want to call the code verifier, any can do .
	file:str
		A path to a file where you wish to store the codes.
	length:int , optional
		The length of the codes to be generated.
	letters:bool , optional 
		Set to `True` to include alphabet letters  	.	
	punctuation_chars:bool
		Set to `True` to include punctuation charachters.
	casing:bool
		Set to `upper` , `lower` or `all` to set the casing of the code .
		Options are:
			upper - uppercase letters only
			lower - lowercase letters only
			all   - include all cases 

	Methods
	-------
	ValidateCode ( code:str , email:str , delete_if_valid:bool )-> bool
		This method checks if a code is valid ( present in the codes file ),
		along with the email provided . 

		Returns
		--------
		bool
			Whether the code provided was valid or not
	MakeNewCode( email:str) -> str
		Parameters
		----------
		email:str
			The email address asociated with the code to be generated.

		Returns
		-------
		str
			The code generated
	ClearCodes() -> None
		This method clears all the data in the file where the codes are stored.
