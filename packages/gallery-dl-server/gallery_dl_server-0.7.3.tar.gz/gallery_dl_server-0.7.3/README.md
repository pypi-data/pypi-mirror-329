## Running

### Docker

#### Docker Run

This example uses the `docker run` command to create the container to run the app.

```shell
docker run -d \
  --name gallery-dl \
  -p 9080:9080 \
  -e UID=1000 \
  -e GID=1000 \
  -v "/path/to/config:/config" \
  -v "/path/to/downloads:/gallery-dl" \
  --restart on-failure \
  qx6ghqkz/gallery-dl-server:latest
```

#### Docker Compose

This is an example of a `docker-compose.yaml` service definition which can be used to start a running container with the `docker compose up -d` command.

```yaml
services:
  gallery-dl:
    image: qx6ghqkz/gallery-dl-server:latest
    container_name: gallery-dl
    ports:
      - 9080:9080
    environment:
      - UID=1000
      - GID=1000
    volumes:
      - "/path/to/config:/config"
      - "/path/to/downloads:/gallery-dl"
    restart: on-failure
```

This is another example which uses a VPN client container for its networking.

```yaml
services:
  gallery-dl:
    image: qx6ghqkz/gallery-dl-server:latest
    container_name: gallery-dl
    network_mode: container:vpn
    environment:
      - UID=1000
      - GID=1000
    volumes:
      - "/path/to/config:/config"
      - "/path/to/downloads:/gallery-dl"
    restart: on-failure
```

[Gluetun](https://github.com/qdm12/gluetun) is recommended for VPN usage. See [docs/docker-compose.yaml](https://github.com/qx6ghqkz/gallery-dl-server/blob/main/docs/docker-compose.yaml) for an example.

#### Port Mapping

By default, this service listens on port 9080. Any value can be used for the host port, but the `CONTAINER_PORT` environment variable needs to be set to change the internal container port. This can be done using the `-e` flag with `docker run` or in a Docker Compose file.

For example, to run multiple instances of gallery-dl-server using a single [Gluetun](https://github.com/qdm12/gluetun) instance for the networking (each instance must use a different internal port), a different container port can be set for one of the containers.

```yaml
services:
  instance-1:
    image: qx6ghqkz/gallery-dl-server:latest
    container_name: day
    depends_on:
      - gluetun
    network_mode: service:gluetun
    [...]

  instance-2:
    image: qx6ghqkz/gallery-dl-server:latest
    container_name: night
    environment:
      - CONTAINER_PORT=9090
    depends_on:
      - gluetun
    network_mode: service:gluetun
    [...]

  gluetun:
    image: qmcgaw/gluetun:latest
    container_name: vpn
    ports:
      # instance-1
      - 9080:9080
      # instance-2
      - 9090:9090
    [...]
```

#### Important Notes

- Make sure to mount the directory containing the configuration file rather than the file itself. This ensures changes to the configuration file are propagated to the running Docker container and it will not need to be restarted for changes to take effect. More information on this issue [here](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/15793#issuecomment-135411504).

- The output download directory depends on the `base-directory` in your gallery-dl configuration file. Make sure it is the absolute path `/gallery-dl/` instead of the relative path `./gallery-dl/` or else the download directory will need to be mounted to `/usr/src/app/gallery-dl` instead (not recommended).

- The environment variables `UID` and `GID` can be used to change the user ID and group ID of the user running the server process. This is important because downloaded files will be owned by that user. Make sure the IDs match those of the user on the host system. The default `UID:GID` is `1000:1000` when left unspecified.

### Python

If Python 3.10 or later (3.12 is recommended) is installed and on the PATH, the server can simply be run from the command line.

#### Running from Source

Clone this repository and install the dependencies located in `requirements.txt` in a virtual environment, then run the command below in the root folder while inside the virtual environment. On Windows, replace `python3` with `python`.

```shell
python3 -m gallery_dl_server --host "0.0.0.0" --port "9080"
```

The command-line arguments are optional. By default, the server will run on host `0.0.0.0` and an available port will be selected if one is not provided.

To view the full list of command-line arguments, perform `python3 -m gallery_dl_server -h` for help. These arguments can also be specified as environment variables.

#### Installation

The package and its dependencies can be installed with Python by performing `pip install gallery-dl-server`. To also install optional dependencies, perform `pip install gallery-dl-server[full]`. It is recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts.

The package can be installed directly from the source code by performing `pip install .` in the root directory of the cloned repository. Perform `pip install .[full]` to install optional dependencies.

Installation allows running directly from the command line via the command `gallery-dl-server`. To view the list of command-line options, perform `gallery-dl-server -h` for help.

When installed, the log file will be created directly in the home directory of the user as long as the package is not found in the current working directory, in which case a `logs` folder will be created there to store the log file.

### Standalone Executable

On Windows, the program can be run using the prebuilt executable (`.exe`) file, which includes a Python interpreter and the required Python packages. Prebuilt executables for each release can be found in [Releases](https://github.com/qx6ghqkz/gallery-dl-server/releases).

By default, any available port will be selected. To select a specific port, run the executable from the command line and specify the port, and optionally host, as command-line arguments.

```cmd
gallery-dl-server.exe --host "0.0.0.0" --port "9080"
```

When run as an executable, the log file will be created in a `logs` folder in the same directory as the executable.

Configuration files can also be loaded from the same directory as the executable. The bundled releases contain a default configuration file in JSON, YAML and TOML formats, which are all supported.

## Dependencies

All required and optional Python and non-Python dependencies are included in the Docker image and will be available in the running container, however if you are running gallery-dl-server using any of the other methods, i.e. not with a Docker container, some dependencies may need to be installed separately.

In order to run with Python, the dependencies in `requirements.txt` need to be installed in the running Python environment. These Python dependencies are included in the standalone executable and do not need to be installed.

Installation with `pip` only installs the required dependencies by default. Install the `gallery-dl-server[full]` package to install the optional dependencies.

### Optional

- [brotli](https://github.com/google/brotli) or [brotlicffi](https://github.com/python-hyper/brotlicffi): Brotli content encoding support
- [mutagen](https://github.com/quodlibet/mutagen): embed metadata and thumbnails in certain formats
- [pycryptodomex](https://github.com/Legrandin/pycryptodome): decrypt AES-128 HLS streams and other forms of data
- [pyyaml](https://pyyaml.org): YAML configuration file support
- [toml](https://pypi.org/project/toml): TOML configuration file support (<= Python 3.10 only)

Non-Python dependencies are **not included**. [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) is strongly recommended for video and audio conversion and should be accessible from the command line, i.e. on the PATH.

There is also [MKVToolNix](https://mkvtoolnix.download/index.html), which includes [mkvmerge](https://www.matroska.org/downloads/mkvtoolnix.html) for accurate [Ugoira](https://www.pixiv.help/hc/en-us/articles/235584628-What-are-Ugoira) frame timecodes.

Dependencies for [gallery-dl](https://github.com/mikf/gallery-dl#dependencies) and [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#dependencies) are documented in their respective repositories. The majority of these are optional Python dependencies and have been accounted for, however dependencies that are [strongly recommended](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#strongly-recommended) should be installed.

## Configuration

Configuration of gallery-dl is as documented in the [official documentation](https://github.com/mikf/gallery-dl#configuration). A configuration file is **required**.

If run outside of Docker, the [default locations](https://github.com/mikf/gallery-dl#locations) will be used to search for a configuration file. If run as an executable, the current directory will also be searched for a valid configuration file.

Additionally, YAML and TOML configuration files are supported at any of the pre-defined locations.

When run with Docker, the configuration file must be mounted inside the `/config` directory inside the container.

### Docker Locations

- `/config/gallery-dl.conf`
- `/config/gallery-dl.{yaml, yml}`
- `/config/gallery-dl.toml`
- `/config/config.json`
- `/config/config.{yaml, yml}`
- `/config/config.toml`

A [default configuration file](https://github.com/qx6ghqkz/gallery-dl-server/blob/main/docs/gallery-dl.conf) for use with gallery-dl-server has been provided and will automatically be placed in the directory mounted to `/config` if no valid configuration file exists in that location.

For more information on configuration file options, see [gallery-dl/docs/configuration.rst](https://github.com/mikf/gallery-dl/blob/master/docs/configuration.rst).

Any additional locations specified in the configuration file must also exist inside the Docker container. For example, if a cookies file is required, ensure it is placed in a location accessible from within the Docker container.

It is recommended to place any additional files such as archive, cache and cookies files inside the same directory mounted to `/config` along with the configuration file.

## Usage

Downloads can be triggered by supplying the `{{url}}` of the requested video through the web UI or through the REST interface via curl, etc.

### Web UI

Just navigate to `http://{{host}}:9080/gallery-dl` and enter the requested `{{url}}`.

### Curl

```shell
curl -X POST --data-urlencode "url={{url}}" http://{{host}}:9080/gallery-dl/q
```

### Fetch

```javascript
fetch(`http://${host}:9080/gallery-dl/q`, {
  method: "POST",
  body: new URLSearchParams({
    url: url
  })
});
```

### Bookmarklet

The following bookmarklet can be used from the bookmarks bar to send the current page URL to the gallery-dl-server instance running on a particular host.

```javascript
javascript:(function(){var url="http://${host}:9080/gallery-dl/q",newTab=window.open(url,"_blank"),f=newTab.document.createElement("form");f.action=url;f.method="POST";var i=newTab.document.createElement("input");i.name="url";i.type="hidden";i.value=window.location.href;f.appendChild(i);newTab.document.body.appendChild(f);f.submit();})();
```

## Implementation

This service operates using the ASGI web server [`uvicorn`](https://github.com/encode/uvicorn) and is built on the [`starlette`](https://github.com/encode/starlette) ASGI framework.

Downloads are handled by [`gallery-dl`](https://github.com/mikf/gallery-dl) in conjunction with [`yt-dlp`](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp). The integration with gallery-dl uses Python as discussed in [this issue](https://github.com/mikf/gallery-dl/issues/642). For video downloads, gallery-dl imports and uses yt-dlp.

The Docker image is based on [`python:3.12-alpine`](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/python), which in turn is based on [`alpine`](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine).
