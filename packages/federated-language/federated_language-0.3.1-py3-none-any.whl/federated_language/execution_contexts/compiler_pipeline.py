  The `CompilerPipeline` holds very little logic; caching for the

  is initialized with a `compiler_fn`, to which the pipeline itself delegates
  all the actual work of compilation.

  Different TFF backends may accept different executable artifacts; e.g. a
  backend that supports only a map-reduce execution model may accept instances
  of `federated_language.backends.mapreduce.MapReduceForm`. The TFF
  representation of such a
  backend takes the form of an instance of
  `federated_language.framework.SyncContext` or
  `federated_language.framework.AsyncContext`, which would be initialized with a
  `CompilerPipeline` whose `compilation_fn` accepts a
  `federated_language.Computation` and
  returns `federated_language.backends.mapreduce.MapReduceForm`s.
