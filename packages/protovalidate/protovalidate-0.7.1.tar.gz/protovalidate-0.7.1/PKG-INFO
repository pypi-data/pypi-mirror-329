              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

# protovalidate-python

[![CI](https://github.com/bufbuild/protovalidate-python/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/bufbuild/protovalidate-python/actions/workflows/ci.yaml)
[![Conformance](https://github.com/bufbuild/protovalidate-python/actions/workflows/conformance.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/bufbuild/protovalidate-python/actions/workflows/conformance.yaml)
[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/protovalidate.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/protovalidate)

`protovalidate-python` is the Python implementation of [`protovalidate`](https://github.com/bufbuild/protovalidate),
designed to validate Protobuf messages at runtime based on user-defined validation constraints. Powered by Google's
Common Expression Language ([CEL](https://github.com/google/cel-spec)), it provides a flexible and efficient foundation
for defining and evaluating custom validation rules. The primary goal of `protovalidate` is to help developers ensure
data consistency and integrity across the network without requiring generated code.

## The `protovalidate` project

Head over to the core [`protovalidate`](https://github.com/bufbuild/protovalidate/) repository for:

- [The API definition](https://github.com/bufbuild/protovalidate/tree/main/proto/protovalidate/buf/validate/validate.proto):
  used to describe validation constraints
- [Documentation](https://github.com/bufbuild/protovalidate/tree/main/docs): how to apply `protovalidate` effectively
- [Migration tooling](https://github.com/bufbuild/protovalidate/tree/main/docs/migrate.md): incrementally migrate
  from `protoc-gen-validate`
- [Conformance testing utilities](https://github.com/bufbuild/protovalidate/tree/main/docs/conformance.md): for
  acceptance testing of `protovalidate` implementations

Other `protovalidate` runtime implementations include:

- Go: [`protovalidate-go`](https://github.com/bufbuild/protovalidate-go)
- C++: [`protovalidate-cc`](https://github.com/bufbuild/protovalidate-cc)
- Java: [`protovalidate-java`](https://github.com/bufbuild/protovalidate-java)

And others coming soon:

- TypeScript: `protovalidate-ts`

## Installation

To install the package, use pip:

```shell
pip install protovalidate
```

Make sure you have the latest version of `protovalidate-python` by checking the
project's [PyPI page](https://pypi.org/project/protovalidate/).

## Usage

### Implementing validation constraints

Validation constraints are defined directly within `.proto` files. Documentation for adding constraints can be found in
the `protovalidate` project [README](https://github.com/bufbuild/protovalidate) and
its [comprehensive docs](https://github.com/bufbuild/protovalidate/tree/main/docs).

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";

package my.package;

import "google/protobuf/timestamp.proto";
import "buf/validate/validate.proto";

message Transaction {
  uint64 id = 1 [(buf.validate.field).uint64.gt = 999];
  google.protobuf.Timestamp purchase_date = 2;
  google.protobuf.Timestamp delivery_date = 3;

  string price = 4 [(buf.validate.field).cel = {
    id: "transaction.price",
    message: "price must be positive and include a valid currency symbol ($ or £)",
    expression: "(this.startsWith('$') || this.startsWith('£')) && double(this.substring(1)) > 0"
  }];

  option (buf.validate.message).cel = {
    id: "transaction.delivery_date",
    message: "delivery date must be after purchase date",
    expression: "this.delivery_date > this.purchase_date"
  };
}
```

### Generating Code with `buf`

When using the runtime library after installing it with `pip`, it's necessary to generate the Python code for the core `buf.protovalidate` Protobuf package. `buf` provides an efficient method for this:

1. **Initialize a New Configuration File**:
   ```shell
   buf config init
   ```
   This initializes the `buf.yaml` configuration file at the root of the Protobuf source files.

2. **Module Configuration and Dependencies**:
   ```yaml
   # buf.yaml
   version: v2
   deps:
     - buf.build/bufbuild/protovalidate
   ```

   Ensure your dependencies are up-to-date with:
   ```shell
   buf dep update
   ```

3. **Setup Code Generation**:
   ```yaml
   # buf.gen.yaml
   version: v2
   plugins:
     - remote: buf.build/protocolbuffers/python
       out: gen
   ```

4. **Generate Code**:
   To generate the required Python code:
   ```shell
   buf generate --include-imports
   ```

5. **Specify import paths**:
   Ensure that the generated code is importable by setting the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable:
   ```shell
   export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:gen
   ```

If your goal is to generate code specifically for the `buf.protovalidate` Protobuf package, run:
```shell
buf generate buf.build/bufbuild/protovalidate
```

> **Note:** For users familiar with `protoc`, while it's an alternative to `buf`, it is recommended to use tooling or frameworks like Bazel for direct code generation, as it provides an encapsulated environment for such tasks.

### Example

```python
import protovalidate
from google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2 import Timestamp
from my.package import Transaction

transaction = Transaction()
transaction.id = 1234
transaction.price = "$5.67"
transaction.purchase_date.CopyFrom(Timestamp())
transaction.delivery_date.CopyFrom(Timestamp())

try:
    protovalidate.validate(transaction)
except protovalidate.ValidationError as e:
# Report the violations
```
