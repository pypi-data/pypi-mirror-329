# simple_keystore

This is a simple key storage solution for development or on-prem use. Use secrets/other builtin more-secure provider methods for production.

Uses an SQLite database to store/retrieve encrypted keys with metadata including expiration dates. 

Uses Redis to throttle key usage.

There is a Dockerfile included, and .devcontainer for use with VSCode. 

## Requirements

If you are going to use the throttler (SKSRateThrottler), you will need Redis. This is not necessary if just using SimpleKeystore.

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y redis-server
sudo service redis-server start 
```

## Installation
```bash
pip install simple_keystore
```
## Usage

You can set the encryption key either via environment variable or as an entry in your .netrc where the password is the key and machine is SIMPLE_KEYSTORE_KEY

```bash
export SIMPLE_KEYSTORE_KEY = "myencryptionkeyphrase"
```

Create an SQLite DB to store keys in python:
```python
ks = SimpleKeyStore(KEYSTORE_FILE_NAME)

# See tests/test_simple_keystore.py for adding keys, etc.
```

Add/Remove keys manually / intractively in bash with:
```bash
manage_simple_keys <KEYSTORE_FILE_NAME>
```
