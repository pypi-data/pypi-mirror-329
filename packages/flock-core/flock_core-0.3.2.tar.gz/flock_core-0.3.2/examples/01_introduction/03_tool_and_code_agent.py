Title: Celebrity Age Calculator with Themed Output and Tool Integration

In this example, you'll see an advanced Flock agent in action. This agent demonstrates several cool features:
  - **Themed Output:** We use ThemedAgentResultFormatter with a custom theme (e.g. "adventuretime")
    to spice up the CLI output.
  - **Tool Integration:** The agent is configured with multiple tools, so it can, for example,
    use web search and code evaluation to calculate some advanced maths.
  - **Caching:** Enabled caching ensures that if you run the agent with the same input,
    it will return a cached resultâ€”ideal for expensive operations or rapid testing.
  - **Simple Declaration:** Just like all Flock agents, this one declares what it needs ("a_person")
    and what it produces ("persons_age_in_days"), without the hassle of prompt engineering.

In this scenario, our agent ("my_celebrity_age_agent") takes a person's name as input and returns
that person's age in days. We then use it to calculate Johnny Depp's age in days. Very advanced maths!

Let's see how it's done!
