Title: Random User List Generator with Data Class Integration and Caching

In this example, you'll see a simple Flock agent in action that generates a list of random users.
This example demonstrates several cool features:
  - **Data Class Integration:** We define a `RandomPerson` dataclass to structure the random user data.
  - **Caching:** Enabled caching ensures that if you run the agent with the same input,
    it will return a cached resultâ€”ideal for speeding up repeated requests.
  - **Simple Agent Declaration:** Like all Flock agents, this one declares what it needs 
    ("amount_of_people") and what it produces ("random_user_list: list[RandomPerson]") 
    without the hassle of prompt engineering.

In this scenario, our agent ("people_agent") takes the number of people to generate as input,
and returns a list of randomly generated users. We then print the number of generated users.
Let's see how it's done!
