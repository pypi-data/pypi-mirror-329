Entry 1 - Beginnings of a Dream
“I have begun the construction of the mansion. The site was perfect: secluded, hidden in the shadow of the mountains, far from the prying eyes of the world. This will be my legacy—a 
grand estate that will stand as a testament to my success. But it will be more than just a home. This place will be a sanctuary. For what, I am not yet sure, but I feel as though I 
am building something that will outlast me. Something... greater.”

Entry 7 - The Architect's Warnings
“I’ve received strange advice from the architect. He suggests that the mansion be built not just to endure the ravages of time, but to manipulate it. He speaks of a force beyond our 
understanding, something that could sustain us, even preserve us for eternity. I am beginning to think he knows more than he’s letting on. Is it possible? Time itself, as fluid as 
the air we breathe, could be contained within these walls? I am intrigued... and yet, wary.”

Entry 13 - Neel-thee’s Influence
“He has arrived. Neel-thee. I do not know where he comes from, nor do I understand his true purpose, but his presence is undeniable. He claims to be an expert in the study of the 
mind. He has offered to assist me with the mansion’s ‘true potential.’ There are whispers of immortality, of breaking free from the boundaries of time. I am not entirely convinced, 
but he has a peculiar way about him. A quiet power, and a gaze that chills me to the core. I have agreed to allow him to stay, for now.”

Entry 22 - The Pact
“Neel-thee’s influence has grown. It is clear that he is not simply an academic. He has performed experiments in the mansion’s hidden chambers—secret rituals, something that bends 
the very laws of nature. The walls seem to pulse with a strange energy now, an unseen force that makes me feel both powerful and fearful. We’ve come to an agreement: he will oversee 
the mansion’s true purpose, and in return, I will give him access to its most hidden secrets. I have committed myself to this, for better or worse.”

Entry 31 - A Changing Mind
“Something is wrong. The mansion is no longer just a building. It is alive. The air is thick with a sense of dread, and the once calm halls now echo with whispers I cannot explain. 
Neel-thee has begun to speak of ‘preserving the mansion’s essence’—his words are becoming less coherent, and his requests more bizarre. I fear he has crossed a line, one that cannot 
be undone. I must find a way to stop him, but I am unsure of how. Perhaps... perhaps it is already too late.”

Entry 38 - Neel-thee is Gone
“Neel-thee has been gone for three days now. I do not know when he will return, but I hope he will return soon”

Entry 39 - Neel-thee's Return
“Neel-thee has returned now. He seems angry. I have not seen him since he stomped through the door. I wonder what is bothering him?”

Entry 40 - The Price of Immortality
“The pact has been sealed. Neel-thee has shown me the cost of eternal life, and I am now bound to this place. I have seen the future, and I do not like what I have seen. The mansion 
is a prison, its walls closing in on us, its time-frozen halls trapping us in an endless loop. I will never escape. Neither will Neel-thee. And yet, he seems unperturbed. He remains 
obsessed with his work, his experiments, his need to control everything—everything but the very thing that will consume him in the end. I wonder if I am already beyond saving. 
Perhaps the mansion is not just a building. It is the keeper of souls.”

Entry 78 - The Change
“There is another price of immortality. Over the last 34 days I have been changing, and soon I will not be able to write in this diary anymore. This is the last thing I will put in my diary. This is the last thing you will hear from Geraldo Times.”
