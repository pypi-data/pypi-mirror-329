Codify is a simple command-line tool that quickly generates a well-organized project structure for your deep learning projects. It helps you start your projects with a clean and consistent foundation, promoting best practices and reproducibility.

## Features ðŸ‘‡

*   **Fast Project Setup:**  Get started with a new project in seconds.
*   **Standard Structure:** Creates a directory structure that is commonly used in deep learning projects, making it easy to understand and navigate.
*   **Customizable:**  You provide the project name, and Codify does the rest.
*   **Easy to Use:**  Install with pip and run a single command.
*   **No Dependencies:** Codify itself has minimal dependencies, making it lightweight.
*   **Python-Based:** Written in Python and easily extensible.

## Installation ðŸ’ª
```bash
pip install codify
```

## Usage
:beers: :cocktail: :tropical_drink:
To create a new project structure, simply run:

```bash
create-project <project_name>
```

Replace <project_name> with the desired name for your project.  For example:
```bash
create-project my_awesome_model
```

:page_facing_up: This will create a directory named my_awesome_model in your current working directory with the following structure

```bash
