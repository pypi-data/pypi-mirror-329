JAX implementation of [VMAS](https://github.com/proroklab/VectorizedMultiAgentSimulator) - A vectorized differentiable multi-agent simulator for MARL. This project is a direct port of the original PyTorch-based [VMAS](https://github.com/proroklab/VectorizedMultiAgentSimulator) developed by the [Prorok Lab](https://www.proroklab.org/), rewritten in JAX to provide JIT compilation support and enhanced performance on GPUs/TPUs.

## Features ‚ú®

- **JAX-native** - GPU/TPU support with `jax.jit` compatibility
- **Vectorized** - Batch thousands of environments simultaneously
- **Differentiable** - End-to-end gradients through physics simulations
- **Interactive rendering** - Visualize agent behaviors and interactions

## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è

```bash
pip install jaxvmas
```

For GPU support, first install [JAX with CUDA support](https://github.com/google/jax#installation).

## Quick Start üèÉ

```python
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
from jaxvmas.make_env import make_env

# Create a random key for initialization
key = jax.random.PRNGKey(0)

# Create vectorized environments
num_envs = 32
env = make_env(
    scenario="football",  # or "simple" from MPE scenarios
    num_envs=num_envs,
    PRNG_key=key,
    continuous_actions=True
)

# Reset environment
env, obs = env.reset(PRNG_key=key)

# Random actions
actions = [jnp.zeros((num_envs, agent_action_space.shape[0])) 
           for agent_action_space in env.action_space]

# Step environment
env, obs, rewards, dones, infos = env.step(actions, key)
```

## Performance üöÄ

**Note**: The following benchmarks are preliminary and not comprehensive. Your results may vary depending on hardware and specific scenarios.

### Preliminary Benchmarking on Google Colab GPU

| Configuration | VMAS (original) | JaxVMAS |
|---------------|----------------|---------|
| 1 environment, 200 steps | ~24.63 seconds | ~0.22 seconds simulation time<br>(+~222.87 seconds compile time)<br>Total: ~233 seconds |
| 32 environments, 100,000 steps | 25+ minutes (test stopped) | ~75.20 seconds simulation time<br>(+~302.10 seconds compile time)<br>Total: ~387.05 seconds |

JaxVMAS demonstrates significant speedup in actual simulation time after the initial compilation overhead.

## Supported Scenarios üéÆ

- Football
- MPE (Multi-Particle Environment):
  - Simple
