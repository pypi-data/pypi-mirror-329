    access_token = os.environ["BEARER_TOKEN"]
)

configuration.access_token = os.environ["ACCESS_TOKEN"]


# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with deel_sdk.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = deel_sdk.ContractsApi(api_client)
    after_cursor = 'after_cursor_example' # str | Return next page of results after the given cursor. (optional)

    try:
