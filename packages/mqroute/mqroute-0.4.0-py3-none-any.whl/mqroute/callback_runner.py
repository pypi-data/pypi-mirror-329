"""
This module defines classes and functions essential for handling MQTT callbacks using
an asynchronous event-driven architecture. It focuses on processing MQTT messages,
formatting payloads, and executing user-defined callback methods. Key components include:

- `MQTTMessage`: Represents an MQTT message with its topic and payload.
- `CallbackRequest`: Encapsulates data for managing a callback request, including the
  callback function, payload format, and optional parameters.
- `PayloadFormat`: Enumeration defining supported payload formats, such as `RAW` and `JSON`.
- `CallbackRunner`: Implements a processing loop to manage and execute asynchronous callback
  requests for MQTT messages.

The module is designed to ensure flexibility and reliability when integrating with external
messaging systems, providing tools for message payload conversion and safe execution of callbacks.

    This class provides functionality for processing callback requests in an
    asynchronous event-driven architecture. It maintains a queue of requests
    and a processing loop to handle callbacks either as coroutines or regular
    methods.

    The class is primarily designed to integrate with asynchronous I/O
    operations and supports interaction with external messaging or event
    systems. It ensures callbacks are properly queued and executed in a
    thread-safe manner.
