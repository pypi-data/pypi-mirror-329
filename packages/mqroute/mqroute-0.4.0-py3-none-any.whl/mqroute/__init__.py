"""
MQTT Client Module

This module provides the core implementation classes and utilities for working
with MQTT protocol-based communications. It includes tools for handling MQTT
clients, message payloads, subscriptions, callbacks, and asynchronous processing.

Classes:
- MQTTClient: Core implementation for managing an MQTT client, including
  connecting to brokers, subscribing to topics, and handling message-based
  interactions.
- MQTTMessage: Represents a message communicated via MQTT, encapsulating
  the topic and message payload.
- CallbackRequest: Encapsulates the data related to a callback request in
  response to an MQTT message, supporting flexible callback handling.
- QOS: Enum representing levels of Quality of Service for MQTT messages.
- MQTTSubscription: Represents an MQTT subscription to a specific topic
  with a defined QoS level.
- CallbackResolver: Manages the dynamic registration and resolution of
  callbacks based on MQTT topics.
- CallbackRunner: Handles asynchronous processing of callback requests,
  supporting integration with event-driven architectures.
- MQTTClientUserData: Stores client-specific user data for association
  with MQTT client connections.

This module supports dynamic and scalable integration with MQTT message
brokers and is suitable for use in distributed messaging systems.
