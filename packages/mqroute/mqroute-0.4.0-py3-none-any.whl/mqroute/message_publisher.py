"""
This module contains the `MessagePublisher` class, which is designed for managing
the publishing of messages to an MQTT client using an asynchronous queue. It also
includes the `PublishMessage` dataclass for encapsulating message details and the
`QOS` enumeration for defining message delivery guarantees.

Classes:
- `MessagePublisher`: Handles message publishing to an MQTT client with reliability
  and asynchronous execution.
- `PublishMessage`: Represents a message to be published, including topic, payload,
  Quality of Service (QoS), and other options.
- `QOS`: Defines the levels of Quality of Service for message delivery in MQTT protocols.

Functionality:
- Manages an internal asynchronous queue to store and process messages.
- Supports setting and retrieving an asynchronous event loop for managing tasks.
- Enables publishing of messages with specified QoS and delivery options.

    """
    Handles publishing messages to an MQTT client using an asyncio queue.

    This class provides an interface for publishing messages to an MQTT client
    via an asyncio queue. It maintains an internal state to ensure message
    publishing is executed correctly. It requires an MQTT client to be passed
    during initialization. This class is designed to operate asynchronously and
    handle messages efficiently using an event loop.

    Note: A queue is used between the user of this class and the actual message publishing step
    to avoid potential deadlocks in `paho.mqtt`. This is because `paho.mqtt` does not allow direct
    publishing of messages from within message-handling callbacks.

    However, if - and when -  the `Callback_runner` is used,
    then the intermediary queue is not strictly necessary, as the callbacks will not block the
    publishing process.
