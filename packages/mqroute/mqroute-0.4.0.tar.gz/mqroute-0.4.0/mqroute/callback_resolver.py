class CallbackResolver:
    """
    Manages the registration and resolution of callbacks bound to topics. It acts as a route
    handler for topics, allowing dynamic registration of callback functions which are invoked
    based on topic matches. This is particularly useful in systems handling message-based
    communication, such as MQTT.

    Attributes and methods within this class ensure that topics comply with certain patterns
    and assist in retrieving appropriate callbacks for a given topic.

        """
        Registers a callback function for a specific MQTT topic. This function processes
        a topic string by splitting it into parts, registering the callback function with
        the nodes, and constructing the real topic string for subscription. Standard MQTT
        wildcards are supported:
           - "#" matches any topics under the current level, including multilevel matches.
           - "+" matches exactly one level.
           - If there is a need to capture the value of single level wildcard matched
             by + a parameter can be created. This is achieved by using - instead of
             single + as MQTT standard - syntax like +<parameter_name>+
             The CallbackResolver will then create a parameter <parameter_name> that is
             assigned with value found in the matched topic.

        :param topic: The MQTT topic string to register the callback with. Contains
            segments delimited by '/' where wildcards '+' or '#' might be used.
        :type topic: str

        :param callback: The function to be invoked when a message matching the given
            topic is received. It must accept three parameters: the string representation
            of the topic, the MQTTMessage object, and an optional dictionary of string
            parameters.
        :type callback: Callable[[str, MQTTMessage, Optional[dict[str, str]]], None]
