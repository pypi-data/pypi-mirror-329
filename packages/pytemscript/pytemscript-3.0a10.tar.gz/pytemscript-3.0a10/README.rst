The ``pytemscript`` package provides a Python wrapper for both standard and advanced scripting
interfaces of Thermo Fisher Scientific and FEI microscopes. The functionality is
limited to the functionality of the original scripting interfaces. For detailed information
about TEM scripting see the documentation accompanying your microscope.

Within the ``pytemscript`` package two implementations for the high level microscope interface are provided:
one for running scripts directly on the microscope PC and one to run scripts remotely over network (not yet available).

Currently the ``pytemscript`` package requires Python 3.4 or higher. The current plan is to keep the minimum
supported Python version at 3.4, since this is the latest Python version supporting Windows XP.

This is a GPL fork of the original BSD-licensed project: https://github.com/niermann/temscript
New changes and this whole product is distributed under either version 3 of the GPL License, or
(at your option) any later version.

Documentation
-------------

The documentation can be found at https://pytemscript.readthedocs.io or locally in the docs/ direcory.

Installation
------------

.. warning:: The project is still in development phase, no beta version has been released yet. Installing from sources is recommended.

Requirements:

    * python >= 3.4
    * comtypes
    * mrcfile
    * pillow
    * numpy

Installation from PyPI on Windows
#################################

This assumes you have connection to the internet.

Execute from the command line (assuming you have your Python interpreter in the path):

.. code-block:: python

    py -m pip install --upgrade pip
    py -m pip install pytemscript

Offline-Installation from wheels file on Windows
################################################

This assumes you have downloaded the wheels file <downloaded-wheels-file>.whl for temscript and comtypes into the current folder.

Execute from the command line (assuming you have your Python interpreter in the path):

.. code-block:: python

    py -m pip install comtypes mrcfile pillow numpy pytemscript --no-index --find-links .

If you want to install pytemscript from sources (you still need to download comtypes \*.whl):

.. code-block:: python

    py -m pip install comtypes mrcfile pillow numpy --no-index --find-links .
    py -m pip install -e <source_directory>
