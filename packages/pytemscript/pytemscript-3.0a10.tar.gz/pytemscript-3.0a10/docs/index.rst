Introduction
------------

The ``pytemscript`` package provides a Python wrapper for both standard and advanced scripting
interfaces of Thermo Fisher Scientific and FEI microscopes. The functionality is
limited to the functionality of the original scripting interfaces. For detailed information
about TEM scripting see the documentation accompanying your microscope.

Within the ``pytemscript`` package two implementations for the high level microscope interface are provided:
one for running scripts directly on the microscope PC and one to run scripts remotely over network (not yet available).

Currently the ``pytemscript`` package requires Python 3.4 or higher. The current plan is to keep the minimum
supported Python version at 3.4, since this is the latest Python version supporting Windows XP.

This is a GPL fork of the original BSD-licensed project: https://github.com/niermann/temscript
New changes and this whole product is distributed under either version 3 of the GPL License, or
(at your option) any later version.

Installation
------------

.. warning:: The project is still in development phase, no beta version has been released yet. Installing from sources is recommended.

Requirements:

    * python >= 3.4
    * comtypes
    * mrcfile
    * numpy

Installation from PyPI on Windows
#################################

This assumes you have connection to the internet.

Execute from the command line (assuming you have your Python interpreter in the path):

.. code-block:: python

    py -m pip install --upgrade pip
    py -m pip install pytemscript

Offline-Installation from wheels file on Windows
################################################

This assumes you have downloaded the wheels file <downloaded-wheels-file>.whl for temscript and comtypes into the current folder.

Execute from the command line (assuming you have your Python interpreter in the path:

.. code-block:: python

    py -m pip install numpy comtypes mrcfile pytemscript --no-index --find-links .

If you want to install pytemscript from sources (you still need to download comtypes \*.whl):

.. code-block:: python

    py -m pip install numpy comtypes mrcfile --no-index --find-links .
    py -m pip install -e <source_directory>

Quick example
-------------

Execute this on the microscope PC (with ``pytemscript`` package installed) to create an instance of the local
:class:`Microscope` interface:

.. code-block:: python

    from pytemscript.microscope import Microscope
    microscope = Microscope()

Show the current acceleration voltage:

.. code-block:: python

    microscope.gun.voltage
    300.0

Move beam:

.. code-block:: python

    shift = microscope.optics.illumination.beam_shift
    shift += (0.4, 0.2)
    shift *= 2
    microscope.optics.illumination.beam_shift = shift

Take an image:

.. code-block:: python

    image = microscope.acquisition.acquire_tem_image("BM-Ceta",
                                                     size=AcqImageSize.FULL,  # <-- see enumerations
                                                     exp_time=0.5,
                                                     binning=2)
    image.save("img.mrc")

Testing
-------

The package provides a few command-line scripts to test the microscope interface connection and image acquisition:

.. code-block:: python

    pytemscript-test -h
    pytemscript-test-acquisition
