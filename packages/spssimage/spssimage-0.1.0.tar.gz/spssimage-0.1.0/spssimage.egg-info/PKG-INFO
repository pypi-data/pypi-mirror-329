# spssimage

A lightweight Python library for creating and manipulating images, including generating star maps with dynamic effects like twinkling stars and gradients.

## Features

- Create static images with shapes, gradients, and colors.
- Generate animations (e.g., twinkling stars) and export them as GIFs.
- Apply radial gradients to simulate gas clouds.
- Lightweight and independent of external libraries like OpenCV or Pillow.

## Installation

Install the library using pip:

```bash
pip install spssimage
```

USAGE:
from spssimage.core import Canvas

# Create a canvas

canvas = Canvas(100, 100, background=(0, 0, 0))

# Define pixel positions for twinkling

pixel_positions = [(20, 20), (50, 50), (80, 80)]

# Define the base color of the twinkling pixels

base_color = (255, 255, 255)

# Save the twinkling pixels as a GIF

canvas.save_gif(pixel_positions, base_color, "twinkling_pixels.gif", frames=30, duration=100, loop=0)
