# validio-plotting

This is a tool that uses the [`validio-sdk`] to fetch metrics and plot them in
the terminal.

## Usage

The application uses the same CLI system as `validio-cli` which will hopefully
make you feel familiar.

```sh
â€º validio-plotting  --historical-minutes 10 --refresh-interval 2
```
