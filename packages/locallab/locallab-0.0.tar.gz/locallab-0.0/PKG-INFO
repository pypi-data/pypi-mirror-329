LocalLab is a powerful, lightweight AI inference server designed to deliver cutting-edge language model capabilities on your local machine or through Google Colab. It empowers developers and researchers to run sophisticated AI models on local hardware, optimizing resources with advanced features such as dynamic model loading, memory optimizations, and real-time system monitoring.

## What Problem Does LocalLab Solve?

- **Local Inference:** Run advanced language models without relying on expensive cloud services.
- **Optimized Performance:** Utilize state-of-the-art techniques like quantization, attention slicing, and CPU offloading for maximum efficiency.
- **Seamless Deployment:** Easily switch between local deployment and Google Colab, leveraging ngrok for public accessibility.
- **Effective Resource Management:** Automatically monitor and manage CPU, RAM, and GPU usage to ensure smooth operation.

## System Requirements

### Minimum Requirements
| Component | Local Deployment | Google Colab |
|-----------|-----------------|--------------|
| RAM | 4GB | Free tier (12GB) |
| CPU | 2 cores | 2 cores |
| Python | 3.8+ | 3.8+ |
| Storage | 2GB free | - |
| GPU | Optional | Available in free tier |

### Recommended Requirements
| Component | Local Deployment | Google Colab |
|-----------|-----------------|--------------|
| RAM | 8GB+ | Pro tier (24GB) |
| CPU | 4+ cores | Pro tier (4 cores) |
| Python | 3.9+ | 3.9+ |
| Storage | 5GB+ free | - |
| GPU | CUDA-compatible | Pro tier GPU |

## Key Features

- **Multiple Model Support:** Pre-configured models along with the ability to load custom ones on demand.
- **Advanced Optimizations:** Support for FP16, INT8, and INT4 quantization, Flash Attention, and attention slicing.
- **Robust Resource Monitoring:** Real-time insights into system performance and resource usage.
- **Flexible Client Libraries:** Comprehensive clients available for both Python and Node.js.
- **Google Colab Friendly:** Dedicated workflow for deploying via Google Colab with public URL access.

## Architecture Overview

Below is an illustration of LocalLab's architecture:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[User] --> B[LocalLab Client (Python/Node.js)];
    B --> C[LocalLab Server];
    C --> D[Model Manager];
    D --> E[Hugging Face Models];
    C --> F[Optimizations];
    C --> G[Resource Monitoring];
```

### Model Loading & Optimization Flow
```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Load Model Request] --> B{Check Resources};
    B -->|Sufficient| C[Load Model];
    B -->|Insufficient| D[Apply Optimizations];
    D --> E[Quantization];
    D --> F[Attention Slicing];
    D --> G[CPU Offloading];
    E & F & G --> H[Load Optimized Model];
    C & H --> I[Ready for Inference];
```

### Resource Management Flow
```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Client Request] --> B[Resource Monitor];
    B --> C{Check Resources};
    C -->|OK| D[Process Request];
    C -->|Low Memory| E[Optimize/Unload];
    C -->|GPU Full| F[CPU Fallback];
    E & F --> G[Continue Processing];
    D & G --> H[Return Response];
```

## Google Colab Workflow

When deploying on Google Colab, LocalLab uses ngrok to create a public tunnel. The workflow is depicted below:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User (Colab)
    participant S as LocalLab Server
    participant N as Ngrok Tunnel
    U->>S: Run start_server(ngrok=True)
    S->>N: Establish public tunnel
    N->>U: Return public URL
    U->>S: Connect via public URL
```

## Get Started

1. **Installation:**
   ```bash
   pip install locallab
   ```

2. **Starting the Server Locally:**
   ```python
   from locallab import start_server
   start_server()
   ```

3. **Starting the Server on Google Colab:**
   ```python
   !pip install locallab
   import os
   os.environ["NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN"] = "your_token_here"
   from locallab import start_server
   start_server(ngrok=True)
   ```

4. **Connecting your Client:**
   ```python
   from locallab.client import LocalLabClient
   client = LocalLabClient("http://localhost:8000")  # Use ngrok URL for Colab deployment
   ```
