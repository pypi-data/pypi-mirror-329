**A python package for prototype-based feature selection**

Nafes is a prototype-based feature selection package designed as a wrapper centered on the highly interpretable and powerful Generalized Matrix Learning Vector Quantization (GMLVQ) classification algorithm and its local variant (LGMLVQ). Nafes utilizes the learned relevances evaluated by the mutation validation scheme for Learning Vector quantization (LVQ), which iteratively converges to selected features that relevantly contribute to the prototype-based classifier decisions. 

    

## Installation
nafes can be installed using pip.
```python
pip install nafes
```

If you have installed nafes before and want to upgrade to the latest version, you can run the following command in your terminal:
Prosemble can be installed using pip.
```python
pip install -U nafes
```


To install the development version from GitHub using Git, run the following command in your terminal:
```python
pip install git+https://github.com/naotoo1/nafes
```
