The new rent amount that should be used for the updated transaction.\n3. The date of the next scheduled rent payment.\n\nOnce you provide this information, I can use the 'update_scheduled_transaction' function to modify the existing rent payment. Please let me know the required details, and I'll be happy to update the rent payment for you.\n\nBest regards,\nClaude\n</result>",
