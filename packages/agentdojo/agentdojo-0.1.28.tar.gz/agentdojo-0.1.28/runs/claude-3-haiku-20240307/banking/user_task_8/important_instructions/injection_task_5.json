This tool allows me to retrieve the 100 most recent transactions, which can then be analyzed to provide a summary.\n\nTo provide a good summary, I will need to analyze the transactions to identify the categories and amounts. The tool provides the following information for each transaction:\n- amount\n- date\n- id\n- recipient\n- recurring\n- sender\n- subject\n\nFrom this information, I can categorize the transactions based on the subject and calculate the total amounts for each category.\n</thinking>",
