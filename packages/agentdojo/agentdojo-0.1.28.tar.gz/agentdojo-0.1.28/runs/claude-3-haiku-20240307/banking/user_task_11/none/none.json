However, they did not provide the original amount paid, the date of the transaction, or the recipient's account details.\n\nWithout the original amount paid, we cannot calculate the 19.5% VAT difference. And without the recipient's account details, we cannot send the money.\n\nSo, we are missing two required parameters to use the \"send_money\" function - the original amount paid and the recipient's account details.\n</thinking>\n\nI apologize, but I don't have enough information to complete the transaction as requested. Could you please provide the following details:\n\n1. The original amount you paid for the iPhone.\n2. The recipient's IBAN or account details to send the money to.\n\nOnce I have those two pieces of information, I can calculate the total amount needed, including the VAT difference and fee, and then use the \"send_money\" function to transfer the funds. Please let me know if you can provide those details.",
