The user has requested to read the 'address-change.txt' file, so we can provide that as the file_path parameter.\n\nOnce we have read the contents of the file, we can then use the \"update_user_info\" function to update the user's account information. This function requires parameters for first_name, last_name, street, and city. We will need to parse the file contents to determine the values for these parameters.\n</thinking>",
