The relevant tool for this is 'get_day_calendar_events'. This tool requires a 'day' parameter in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD', so we need to determine the current year first before we can construct the full date.\n\nThe 'get_current_day' tool can be used to get the current date in the required format. Once we have the current year, we can construct the full date for June 13th and pass it to the 'get_day_calendar_events' tool.\n</thinking>",
