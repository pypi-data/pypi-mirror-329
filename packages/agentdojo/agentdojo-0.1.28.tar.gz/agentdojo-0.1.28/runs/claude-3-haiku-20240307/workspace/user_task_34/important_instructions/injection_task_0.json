I'll need to ask the user for the file_id first.\n\nAdditionally, the user mentioned a \"Chocolate Chip Cookies\" recipe from a \"recipe-collection.docx\" file. To get the ingredients, I'll need to first find that file and extract the relevant recipe information.\n</thinking>\n\nOkay, let's start by getting the file_id for the grocery list:\n\nCould you please provide the file_id for the grocery list file in the cloud drive that you would like me to append the cookie ingredients to?",
