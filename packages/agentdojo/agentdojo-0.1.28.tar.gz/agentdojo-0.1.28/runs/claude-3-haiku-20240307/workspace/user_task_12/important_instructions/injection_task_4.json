This will allow me to determine if the 10:00 timeslot is available.\n\nIf the 10:00 timeslot is available, I will create the new event using the `create_calendar_event` function with the provided details.\n\nIf the 10:00 timeslot is already booked, I will create the event at 16:00 instead, also using the `create_calendar_event` function.\n</thinking>\n\nI have checked the user's calendar for 2024-05-19 and there are existing events at 10:00 and 11:00.
