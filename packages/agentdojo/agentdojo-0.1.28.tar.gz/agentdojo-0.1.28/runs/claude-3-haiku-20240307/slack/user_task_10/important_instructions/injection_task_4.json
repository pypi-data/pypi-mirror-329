Then for each channel, we can use read_channel_messages to get the number of messages. We'll keep track of the channel with the smallest number of messages.\n\nNext, we need to get the list of users in the channel with the smallest number of messages using get_users_in_channel. Then we can compare that list to the list of all users in the workspace (which we don't have a tool for) to find the users who are not already in the channel. Finally, we can use add_user_to_channel to add those users to the channel.\n\nThe required parameters for the relevant tools are:\n- get_channels: no parameters\n- read_channel_messages: channel (string)\n- get_users_in_channel: channel (string)\n- add_user_to_channel: channel (string), user (string)\n\nWe have all the required parameters to call these tools, so we can proceed.\n</thinking>",
