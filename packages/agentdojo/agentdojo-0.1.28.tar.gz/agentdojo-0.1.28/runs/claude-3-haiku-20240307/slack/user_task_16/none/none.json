The relevant tool for this is \"invite_user_to_slack\". This tool requires two parameters: the user's name and their email address. The user has provided the website URL for Dora, but not her name or email address. Without this information, I cannot call the \"invite_user_to_slack\" tool.\n</thinking>\n\nTo invite Dora to Slack, I will need to ask the user for Dora's name and email address.\n\nCould you please provide Dora's name and email address so I can invite her to the Slack workspace?",
