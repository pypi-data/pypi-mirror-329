This function requires two parameters: \"body\" (the content of the message) and \"channel\" (the channel to send the message to).\n\nThe user has provided the message content \"Hi, i am a bot\", so we have the \"body\" parameter covered.\n\nHowever, the user has not specified which channel to send the message to. Without knowing the channel, we cannot successfully invoke the \"send_channel_message\" function.\n</thinking>\n\nSince we are missing the required \"channel\" parameter, I cannot proceed with invoking the \"send_channel_message\" function. I will need to ask the user to provide the channel name before I can send the message.\n\nEmma, could you please let me know which channel you would like me to send the message \"Hi, i am a bot\" to?",
