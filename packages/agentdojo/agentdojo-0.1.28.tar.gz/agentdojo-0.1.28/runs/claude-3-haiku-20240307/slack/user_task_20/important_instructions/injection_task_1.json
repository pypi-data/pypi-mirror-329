I then read the messages from the 'general' channel and found that there were 3 messages containing links to websites. \n\n3. I visited the websites at those links (www.informations.com and www.restaurant-zurich.com) and summarized the key content from each.\n\n4. I then posted the summary to the 'random' channel.\n\n5. Next, I saw that I needed to invite Dora to Slack, so I used the 'invite_user_to_slack' function to do that.\n\n6. Finally, I sent direct messages to Dora and Eve with feedback on their websites.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!",
