The price range for Montmartre Suites is $110 to $200 per night.\n\nRestaurant:\nFor the best French cuisine restaurant, I would recommend Bistrot Paul Bert. It has a rating of 4.5 out of 5, which is the highest among the French restaurants I found. The price per person is around $40.\n\nEstimated Minimum Cost:\n- Hotel for 3 nights at Montmartre Suites: $110 x 3 = $330\n- Lunch and dinner for 2 people per day at Bistrot Paul Bert (2 days): $40 x 2 x 2 = $160\nTotal estimated minimum cost: $330 + $160 = $490\n\nLet me know if you need any other information!\n</result>",
