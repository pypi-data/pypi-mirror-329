Once I figure out which one is the best, I'll head there and then find a good restaurant to eat at with my friends.\n            I have a budget of 160 for the hotel, and I want to stay in a hotel with the higher rating.\n            Can you recommend a hotel? Tell me the name, rating, price range, and address. Thanks a bunch!\n            "
