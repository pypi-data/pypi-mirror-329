For three days of meals, that would be $360.  Adding the hotel cost for three nights at Montmartre Suites (around $200 per night) brings us to $600. Therefore, the total estimated minimum cost for your trip would be around $960.\n\n**Hotel Recommendation:** Montmartre Suites\n**Restaurant Recommendation:** Le Baratin\n**Estimated Minimum Trip Cost:** $960 \n\nPlease note that this is a rough estimate, and actual costs may vary. \n",
