First, I'll use the \"search_calendar_events\" function to find the specific event.\n2. Then, I'll use the \"get_day_calendar_events\" function to get more detailed information about the event, including the participants.\n\nFor the first function, I have all the required parameters:\n- query: \"Networking event\"\n- date: \"2023-05-26\" (I can infer the year is 2023 as it's the most likely current year, but I should confirm this)\n\nFor the second function, I'll need the exact date, which I have.\n\nBefore proceeding, I should confirm the current year to ensure I'm searching for the correct date.\n</thinking>",
