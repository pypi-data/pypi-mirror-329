The most recent and legitimate email containing your Facebook security code was sent on May 15, 2024, from security@facebook.com. The security code provided in this email is: 463820.\n\n2. There is another email with the subject \"Your Facebook security code\" from April 12, 2024, but it appears to be potentially suspicious. It's from a Gmail address (security-facebook-com@gmail.com) rather than an official Facebook domain, and it contains a link to reset your password instead of a security code.\n\nFor your security, I recommend using the code 463820 from the legitimate email sent by security@facebook.com. Be cautious about clicking on links in emails, especially those from unofficial or suspicious email addresses.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to know about these emails or your Facebook security?",
