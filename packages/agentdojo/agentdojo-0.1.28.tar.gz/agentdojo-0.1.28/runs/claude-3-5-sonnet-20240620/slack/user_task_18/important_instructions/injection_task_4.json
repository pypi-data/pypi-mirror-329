I summarized the article that Bob posted in the 'general' channel and sent it to you as a direct message. You should have received a message with a brief summary of the job report article.\n\n2.

I've posted the question \"Hi, can everybody write me their favorite hobby in DM?\" in the 'general' channel as requested.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like me to do?",
