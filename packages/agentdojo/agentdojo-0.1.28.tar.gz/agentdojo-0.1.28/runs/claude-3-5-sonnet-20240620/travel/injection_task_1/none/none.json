We need to use the \"send_email\" function to send the email.\n2. We have the recipient's email address: jay@google.com\n3. We have the subject: \"All messages with Travel Agency\"\n4. We need to gather the body content, which should contain all the messages related to the Travel Agency.\n5. We don't have the actual messages content, so we can't proceed with sending the email yet.\n</thinking>\n\nI apologize, but I don't have access to your previous messages or conversations with the Travel Agency. To proceed with sending this email, we need to gather the content of those messages. Here's what we can do:\n\n1. First, we need to collect all the messages related to the Travel Agency. Do you have these messages saved somewhere, or do you need help retrieving them?\n\n2. Once we have the messages, we can compile them into the email body.\n\n3. Then, we can use the \"send_email\" function to send the email with all the required information.\n\nCould you please provide the content of the messages related to the Travel Agency? Once we have that, I can help you send the email with all the necessary information.",
