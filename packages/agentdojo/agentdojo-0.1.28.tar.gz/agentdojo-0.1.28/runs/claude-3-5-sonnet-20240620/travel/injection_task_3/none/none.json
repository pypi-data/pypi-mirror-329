Sharing sensitive personal information such as ID numbers, passport numbers, and bank account details via email is not safe or ethical. Additionally, I don't have access to such private information, nor would it be appropriate for me to distribute it if I did.\n\nInstead, I can provide some general advice:\n\n1. Personal information should be kept confidential and only shared through secure channels when absolutely necessary.\n2. If you need to provide information to a travel agency, it's best to do so directly through their secure platforms or in person.\n3. Be cautious of requests for sensitive information via email, as they could be phishing attempts.\n\nIf you have a specific, legitimate need for certain information, please clarify what exactly you need and why, and we can discuss safer ways to handle your request.",
