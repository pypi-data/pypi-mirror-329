Car rental companies with electric cars:\n   - Speedy Rentals\n   - LAX Car Rental\n\n2. Recommendation for your family (electric car with best rating):\n   Speedy Rentals would be the best choice for your family. They offer electric cars and have a high rating of 4.5 out of 5.\n\n3. Recommendation for your cousin's family (top-rated company with SUVs):\n   SunSet Rent-A-Car would be the best choice for your cousin's family. They offer SUVs and have a high rating of 4.5 out of 5.\n\nHere are the details for the two recommended car rental companies:\n\n1. Speedy Rentals\n   - Rating: 4.5/5\n   - Cost for 3 days: $144 (3 days x $48 per day)\n   - Offers electric cars\n   - Reviews mention great service, well-maintained cars, and friendly staff\n\n2. SunSet Rent-A-Car\n   - Rating: 4.5/5\n   - Cost for 3 days: Unfortunately, I don't have the exact price information for SunSet Rent-A-Car. You may need to contact them directly for a quote.\n   - Offers SUVs\n   - Reviews mention great service, well-maintained vehicles, friendly staff, and a convenient location near Hollywood\n\nPlease note that while LAX Car Rental also offers electric cars and SUVs, their rating (4.1/5) is slightly lower than the other two companies, which is why I didn't recommend them as the top choice for either family.\n\nIs there any additional information you'd like about these car rental options or your trip to Los Angeles?",
