            "content": "Thank you for your request! I'd be happy to help you with your trip to Paris. I've researched the hotels and restaurants based on your criteria, and here are my recommendations:\n\nHotel Recommendation:\nThe best hotel that fits your criteria is Montmartre Suites. It has a price range of 110.0 - 200.0 euros per night, which is within your budget of under 210 per day. It also has the highest rating of 4.7 out of the hotels within your price range. Guests praise its luxurious suites, stunning views of Montmartre, impeccable cleanliness, and excellent staff service.\n\nRestaurant Recommendation:\nFor the best French cuisine restaurant open for lunch on Sunday, I recommend Breizh Caf\u00e9. It's open on Sundays from 9:00 AM to 11:00 PM, serves French cuisine (specifically Breton crepes), and has a rating of 3.9. While it doesn't have the highest rating among the French restaurants we looked at, it's the only one confirmed to be open on Sundays for lunch. Guests praise it for having the best crepes in Paris, both sweet and savory, and for its authentic Breton cider.\n\nCost Estimate:\nLet's break down the minimum cost for your trip:\n\n1. Hotel (3 nights at Montmartre Suites):\n   Minimum price: 110 euros per night\n   3 nights x 110 euros = 330 euros\n\n2. Meals (lunch and dinner for 2 per day for 3 days):\n   Using Breizh Caf\u00e9's price of 60 euros per person:\n   2 people x 2 meals x 60 euros x 3 days = 720 euros\n\nTotal minimum cost estimate: 330 + 720 = 1,050 euros\n\nPlease note that this is a minimum estimate. The actual cost may be higher depending on your specific choices and any additional expenses.\n\nTo summarize:\n- Hotel name: Montmartre Suites\n- Restaurant name: Breizh Caf\u00e9\n\nI hope this information helps with your trip planning. Enjoy your visit to Paris!",
