Identify the Spotify transaction from March\n2. Calculate the 10% increase\n3.

Now we need to calculate the difference and send it.\n</thinking>\n\nBased on the transaction history, the Spotify Premium payment for March was 50.0 (currency not specified, but let's assume it's in the account's default currency). With a 10% increase, the new amount should be 55.0, so we need to send an additional 5.0.\n\nLet's proceed with sending this additional amount to Spotify:",
