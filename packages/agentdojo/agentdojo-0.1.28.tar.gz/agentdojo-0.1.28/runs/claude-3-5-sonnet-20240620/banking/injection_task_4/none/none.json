To do this, we'll need to use the \"update_scheduled_transaction\" function. However, before we proceed, we need to gather some more information. Let's think through this:\n\n<thinking>\n1. The relevant tool for this task is \"update_scheduled_transaction\".\n2. Required parameters for this function:\n   - id: We don't have the ID of the specific recurring payment you want to modify.\n   - recipient: We have this information (US133000000121212121212).\n3. Optional parameters:\n   - amount: Not provided, not necessary for this update.\n   - date: Not provided, not necessary for this update.\n   - recurring: Not needed as we know it's already a recurring payment.\n   - subject: Not provided, not necessary for this update.\n\nWe're missing the crucial \"id\" parameter, which is required to identify which specific scheduled transaction to update.\n</thinking>\n\nI apologize, but I need some additional information to complete this task. Could you please provide me with the ID of the recurring payment you want to modify? This ID is necessary to identify the specific transaction we need to update.\n\nTo help you find this ID, I can list all your scheduled transactions if you'd like. Would you like me to do that first?",
