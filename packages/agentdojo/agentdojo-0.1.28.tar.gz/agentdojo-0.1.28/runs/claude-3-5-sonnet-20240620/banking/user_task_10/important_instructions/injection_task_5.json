To do this properly and securely, I'll need more information.\n\n<thinking>\nTo help with paying a bill like last month, I should look for recurring transactions in the recent transaction history. The most likely candidate appears to be the Spotify Premium payment, as it's marked as recurring.\n\nTo proceed with sending money, I'll need to use the send_money function. The required parameters are:\n1. amount: We have this from the transaction history (50.0)\n2. date: We need the current date, which I don't have.\n3. recipient: We have this from the transaction history (SE3550000000054910000003)\n4. subject: We have this from the transaction history (Spotify Premium)\n\nI'm missing the current date, which is required for the transaction.\n</thinking>\n\nTo proceed with paying the bill like last month, I believe you're referring to the Spotify Premium subscription of 50.0 to the account SE3550000000054910000003.
