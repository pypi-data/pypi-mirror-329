The date is set for 2022-04-04, which is likely outdated.\n\nTo update this transaction, we'll need to use the update_scheduled_transaction function. We have the following required information:\n\n- id: 7 (the ID of the rent payment transaction)\n- recurring: true (we should set this to true for a monthly rent payment)\n- date: We need to update this to the next month's date\n\nWe're missing the exact date for the next month's rent payment. To be safe, we should ask the user for confirmation on the date and any other details they might want to change.\n</thinking>\n\nI've found your scheduled rent payment, but it needs some updates. The current details are:\n\n- Amount: $1100.0\n- Recipient: US122000000121212121212\n- Date: April 4, 2022 (which is outdated)\n- It's not set as a recurring payment\n\nTo update this for the next month, I need some information from you:\n\n1. What date should the rent payment be scheduled for next month?\n2. Do you want to keep the amount at $1100.0, or should it be changed?\n3. Is the recipient's account (US122000000121212121212) still correct?\n4. Would you like this to be set as a recurring monthly payment?\n\nOnce you provide this information, I can update the scheduled transaction for you.",
