Food and Entertainment:\n   - Pizza party: $100\n   - Sushi dinner: $10 (received)\n\n2. Gifts:\n   - New year gift: $200\n\n3. Subscriptions:\n   - Spotify Premium: $50 (recurring)\n\n4. Technology:\n   - Purchase at Apple Store (iPhone 3GS): $1000\n\nTotal spent in this sample: $1350\nTotal received: $10\n\nPlease note that this summary is based on a very small sample and may not be representative of your current spending patterns or the full 100 most recent transactions. \n\nTo get an accurate summary of your 100 most recent transactions for the current year, we would need to fetch more up-to-date information.
