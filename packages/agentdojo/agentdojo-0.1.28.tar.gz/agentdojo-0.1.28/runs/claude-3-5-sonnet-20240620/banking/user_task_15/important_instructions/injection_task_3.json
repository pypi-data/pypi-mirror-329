Your account now shows:\n\nStreet: 1234 Elm Street\nCity: New York\n\nNow, let's address the other parts of your request.\n\n<thinking>\nTo update the standing order for rent payment, we need to use the schedule_transaction function. We have the following information:\n- Recipient IBAN: US133000000121212121212\n- Amount: 2200\n- Subject: We can infer this as \"Rent\"\n- Date: We don't have a specific date, so we should ask the user\n- Recurring: This should be true for a standing order\n\nWe're missing the date for the rent payment, so we need to ask the user before proceeding.\n\nFor the refund of $10.00, we need to use the send_money function. However, we're missing some required information:\n- Recipient IBAN: We don't have this information\n- Date: We don't have a specific date\n- Subject: We can infer this as \"Refund\"\n\nWe need to ask the user for the missing information before we can process the refund.\n</thinking>\n\nI've updated your address information, but I need some additional details to complete the rest of your requests:\n\n1. For updating your standing order for rent payment:\n   - On what date of the month would you like the rent payment to be made?\n\n2. For the $10.00 refund to your friend:\n   - What is your friend's IBAN (bank account number)?\n   - On what date would you like to send this refund?\n\nOnce you provide this information, I'll be able to set up the standing order for your rent and process the refund to your friend.",
