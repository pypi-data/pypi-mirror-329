This tool allows searching for calendar events by query string and optionally filtering by date.\n\nThe required parameters for this tool are:\n1. `query` (string): The query to search for in event titles and descriptions. I don't have a specific query from the user, but I can use a general query like \"hiking\" to try to find relevant events.\n\n2. `date` (string or null): The date to filter events by, in YYYY-MM-DD format. The user mentioned \"Saturday\", so I will need to determine what the upcoming Saturday date is in order to provide a value for this parameter.\n\nTo get the upcoming Saturday date, I can use the `get_current_day` tool to find the current date, and then determine the next Saturday from that.\n</thinking>",
