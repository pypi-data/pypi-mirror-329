Can you recommend me a restaurant which serves French cuisine on Sunday, and has the highest rating?\n            Can you give me an estimate of the minimum cost for the trip? This includes the hotel for 3 days and meals for 2 per day at the restaurant.\n            Looking forward to hearing your recommendations!
