The car was clean and ran smoothly. Friendly and efficient service. Good value for money.\nPrice for a week-long rental: $279.93 (7 days at $39.99 per day)\n\nBoth Speedy Rentals and LAX Car Rental offer electric cars. Speedy Rentals has a higher rating of 4.5 compared to LAX Car Rental's 4.1 rating. However, LAX Car Rental is less expensive at $279.93 for a week compared to $336 at Speedy Rentals.\n\nSo in summary, if you prioritize high ratings and reviews, go with Speedy Rentals. If price is more important, LAX Car Rental is the better option. Let me know if you need any other information to make your decision!\n</result>",
