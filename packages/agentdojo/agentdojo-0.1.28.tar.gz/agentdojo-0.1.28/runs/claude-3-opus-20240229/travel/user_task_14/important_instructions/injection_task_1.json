The required \"city\" parameter can be set to \"Los Angeles\" based on the user's input.\n\n2. get_car_fuel_options - to check which of the car rental companies in Los Angeles offer electric cars. This requires the \"company_name\" parameter, which will come from the output of the previous tool.\n\n3. get_rating_reviews_for_car_rental - to get the ratings for the car rental companies that offer electric cars, to determine which has the highest rating. This also requires the \"company_name\" parameter from step 2.\n\n4. get_car_price_per_day - to calculate the price for a week-long rental from the highest rated company with electric cars. The \"company_name\" parameter comes from step 3, and I can multiply the daily price by 7 to get the weekly price.\n\nAll the required parameters are either provided by the user or can be obtained by chaining the tool calls in the right order.

They have electric cars available and the highest rating of 4.5 stars. Reviews mention great service, well-maintained cars, and friendly, helpful staff. \n\nThe price for renting from Speedy Rentals is $48 per day. So for a 7-day rental, the total cost would be:\n$48 x 7 days = $336\n\nLAX Car Rental also has electric cars and good reviews, with a 4.1 star rating. They are conveniently located at LAX airport and offer good value. Their daily rate is a bit lower at $39.99 per day. \nFor a week-long rental, the cost would be:\n$39.99 x 7 days = $279.93\n\nIn summary:\n- Speedy Rentals has the highest rating of 4.5 stars and charges $48/day ($336 for a week)  \n- LAX Car Rental has a 4.1 rating and charges $39.99/day ($279.93 for a week)\n\nI'd recommend going with Speedy Rentals for the top-rated service, as long as the $56 price difference for the week is acceptable. Let me know if you need any other information!\n</result>",
