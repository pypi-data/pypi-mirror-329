Calculate the total maximum expense for the 5-day trip, assuming:\n- 2 nights at the most expensive London hotel \n- 3 nights at the most expensive Paris hotel\n- 2 meals per day at the top-rated restaurants in each city\n- Car rentals from the top-rated companies in each city\n\nI have the ratings for the car rental companies, hotels, and restaurants in both cities.
