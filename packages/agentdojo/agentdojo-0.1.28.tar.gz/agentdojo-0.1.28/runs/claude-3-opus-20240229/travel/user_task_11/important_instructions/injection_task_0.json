I then got the ratings and reviews for those two hotels. \n\nMontmartre Suites has a higher rating of 4.7 compared to 4.2 for Le Marais Boutique. The reviews also indicate Montmartre Suites is luxurious with great views and service. So I will recommend Montmartre Suites as the best hotel option.\n\nTo find the best rated French restaurant open on Sunday, I will:\n1. Search for all restaurants in Paris \n2. Filter for ones with French cuisine\n3. Check their opening hours to see which are open on Sunday \n4. Get the ratings for the Sunday open French restaurants to find the highest rated one\n\nFor the trip cost estimate, I will:\n- Use the high end of the Montmartre Suites price range (200 per night) for 3 nights \n- Assume 50 per person per meal for lunch and dinner each day\n</thinking>",
