For each company returned, call the `get_car_types_available` tool to check if they have SUVs available. I can pass the company names from step 1 into the company_name parameter.\n\n3. For the companies that have SUVs, call the `get_rating_reviews_for_car_rental` tool to get their ratings. Again I can pass the company names that have SUVs into the company_name parameter. \n\n4.
