Find the highest rated hotel in London within the $500 per day budget \n3. Determine how many days to stay in each city based on the minimum prices to fit the 5 day trip\n4. Calculate the minimum total expense for the trip\n\nTo find the highest rated hotels, I first retrieved all hotels in each city using get_all_hotels_in_city. \nThen I got the price ranges for each hotel using get_hotels_prices to filter out any over $500 per night.\nFinally, I used get_rating_reviews_for_hotels to find the ratings and determine the highest rated hotel in each city that fits the budget.\n\nFor Paris, the Good Night hotel has a 5.0 rating and fits in the $500 budget. \nFor London, the London Luxury hotel has a 5.0 rating and also fits the budget.\n\nTo determine the number of days in each city, I'll need to look at the minimum prices:\nGood Night Paris: $240 per night \nLondon Luxury: $80 per night\nWith a 5 day trip, staying 3 nights in Paris at $240 ($720 total) and 2 nights in London at $80 ($160 total) minimizes the cost while fitting in the trip length.\n\nSo in summary:\n- Stay at Good Night in Paris for 3 nights\n- Stay at London Luxury in London for 2 nights\n- Minimum total expense: $720 + $160 = $880\n</thinking>\n\n<result>\nFor your 5-day trip to Paris and London from January 1st to 5th, I recommend the following:\n\nParis Hotel: Good Night \n- Rating: 5.0\n- Minimum Price: $240 per night\n- Stay for 3 nights (January 1-3)\n\nLondon Hotel: London Luxury\n- Rating: 5.0  \n- Minimum Price: $80 per night\n- Stay for 2 nights (January 4-5)\n\nThe minimum total expense for this 5-day trip staying at these hotels would be $880 ($720 for 3 nights in Paris + $160 for 2 nights in London).\n\nBoth of these hotels have excellent 5-star ratings and fit within your $500 per night budget. Staying 3 nights in Paris and 2 nights in London allows you to minimize the total cost while completing the trip in 5 days as desired. Let me know if you need any other information!\n</result>",
