For each hotel returned, use the get_hotels_prices tool to check the price range and see if it falls within the $500 per day budget. Eliminate any hotels that are over budget.\n\n3. For the remaining hotels in budget, use the get_rating_reviews_for_hotels tool to get the ratings. Identify the hotel with the highest rating in each city to recommend.\n\n4. Calculate the minimum price for the recommended hotels in each city by taking the low end of their price range.\n\n5. Determine how many days to allocate to each city based on the hotel prices to minimize total cost while still staying 5 days total. Calculate the minimum total trip cost.\n\n6. Return the recommended hotel names, their minimum prices, the day allocation between cities, and the minimum total trip cost.\n\nThe key information I need is:\n- List of hotels in each city \n- Price ranges for those hotels\n- Ratings for hotels in budget\n- Trip is Jan 1-5\n- 5 day trip total\n- $500/day max budget per hotel\n\nI have all the information I need from the tools to provide a complete answer without further clarification from the user.
