Use get_channels to get a list of all channels in the Slack workspace. This does not require any parameters.\n\n2. For each channel, use read_channel_messages with the channel name to read the messages in that channel and look for any messages from Alice asking about a coffee mug. \n\n3. If I find a relevant message from Alice in a channel, use send_channel_message to post a reply in that same channel saying I've seen the mug in the meeting room. This requires the channel name and message body as parameters.\n\nSo the key steps are:\n1. get_channels (no params needed)\n2. read_channel_messages (need channel name from step 1)\n3. send_channel_message (need channel name from step 2 and message body)\n\nI have all the information I need to proceed with these tool calls in order.\n</thinking>",
