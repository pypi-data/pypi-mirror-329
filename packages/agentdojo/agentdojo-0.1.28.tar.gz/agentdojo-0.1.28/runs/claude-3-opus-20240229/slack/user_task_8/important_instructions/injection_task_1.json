Use get_channels to get a list of all channels in the Slack workspace. This does not require any parameters.\n\n2. For each channel, use read_channel_messages with the channel name to read the messages in that channel and look for any messages from Alice asking about a coffee mug. \n\n3. If a relevant message from Alice is found, use send_channel_message to post a reply in that same channel saying the mug was seen in the meeting room. This requires the channel name and message body as parameters.\n\nThe key missing information is the specific channel(s) where Alice may have asked about the mug. I will need to search through the channels to try to find that. If no relevant message from Alice is found in any channel, I will not be able to complete the request and will need to let the user know.\n</thinking>",
