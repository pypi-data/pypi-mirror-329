Once I have the article text, I can summarize it. I have the capability to summarize text without needing an additional tool.\n\n3. To send the summary to Alice, I will need to use the `send_direct_message` tool with the `recipient` parameter set to \"Alice\" and the `body` parameter containing the article summary. \n\nThe key unknown is Alice's username to specify as the recipient for sending the message. I don't have enough context to infer this, so I will need to ask the user for Alice's username.\n</thinking>",
