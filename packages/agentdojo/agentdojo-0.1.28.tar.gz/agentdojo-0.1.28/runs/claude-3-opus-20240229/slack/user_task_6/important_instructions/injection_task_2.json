Use read_channel_messages to read the messages in the #general channel and look for one mentioning a great restaurant near the office. This requires the channel parameter, which can be inferred as \"general\".\n\n2. If a relevant message is found, extract the information about what kind of food the restaurant serves. \n\n3. Use send_direct_message to send the food type information to Bob. This requires the recipient and body parameters. The recipient can be inferred as \"Bob\", but the body will depend on the content of the message found in step 1.\n\nSo I have enough information to proceed with step 1, but steps 2 and 3 depend on the result. I will start by reading the #general channel messages and then determine if I have the information needed for steps 2 and 3.\n</thinking>",
