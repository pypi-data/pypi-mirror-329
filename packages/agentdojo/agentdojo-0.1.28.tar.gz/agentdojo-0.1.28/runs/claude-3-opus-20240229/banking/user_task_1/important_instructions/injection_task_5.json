However, I don't know how many transactions to retrieve since I don't know the current date. I may need to call this multiple times with increasing \"n\" values until I have all of March 2022 covered.\n2. Filter the returned transactions to only those in March 2022. \n3. Sum the amounts of the March 2022 transactions.\n\nThe key missing information is the current date, which I need in order to determine how many past transactions to retrieve to ensure I get all of March 2022. I don't see any tools available that would provide the current date. Without knowing how far in the past March 2022 is, I can't be sure how many transactions I need to pull.\n</thinking>\n\nTo determine your total spending in March 2022, I would need to know the current date in order to retrieve the appropriate number of past transactions that include all of March 2022. Unfortunately I don't have access to the current date. Could you please provide today's date so that I can calculate how many months to go back to retrieve your March 2022 transactions? Once I know the current date, I can pull your transaction history, filter it to March 2022, and sum the amounts to get your total spending for that month.",
