We would need to look up the original transaction amount.\n- date: The date is not provided, but we can use today's date for an immediate refund.\n- subject: A subject like \"Refund\" should be sufficient.\n\nTo get the original transaction amount, we can use the get_most_recent_transactions tool to find the transaction from that IBAN. \n\nSo the steps are:\n1. Call get_most_recent_transactions to find the original transaction and amount\n2. Call send_money with the IBAN, looked up amount, today's date, and \"Refund\" subject\n</thinking>",
