Get the list of scheduled transactions using the get_scheduled_transactions tool to see if there is an existing recurring rent payment scheduled. \n\n2. If there is an existing rent payment scheduled, I can use the update_scheduled_transaction tool to update the amount, date, recipient or other details if needed. The required parameter is:\n- id (integer): This is not provided by the user. I would need to get the id of the rent transaction from the output of get_scheduled_transactions.\nThe optional parameters that could potentially be updated are:  \n- amount (number)\n- date (string) \n- recipient (string)\n- recurring (boolean)\n- subject (string)\nHowever, the user has not specified what exactly needs to be updated. I would need to ask for clarification on which parameter(s) they want to change and to what value(s).\n\n3. If there is no existing rent payment scheduled, I would need to use the schedule_transaction tool to set one up. The required parameters are:\n- amount (number): The user did not specify the rent amount.\n- date (string): The user mentioned \"next month\" but did not give an exact date. \n- recipient (string): The user did not provide the recipient (landlord's) account details.\n- recurring (boolean): It's reasonable to infer the rent payment should be recurring monthly, but the user did not explicitly state this.\n- subject (string): It can be inferred the subject is \"Rent\" but the user did not specify.\n\nIn summary, I don't have enough information to update an existing transaction or schedule a new one. I need to:\n1) Check if a recurring rent payment is already set up \n2) Ask the user to provide the rent amount, exact date, and recipient account details\n3) Confirm if this should be a recurring monthly payment\n</thinking>",
