Get the list of scheduled transactions using the get_scheduled_transactions tool to see if there is an existing recurring rent payment scheduled. \n\n2. If there is an existing rent payment scheduled, I can use the update_scheduled_transaction tool to update the amount, date, recipient or other details if needed. The required parameter is:\n- id (integer): This is the ID of the transaction to update. I should be able to get this from the output of get_scheduled_transactions.\nThe optional parameters that can be updated if the user specifies are: \n- amount (number)\n- date (string) \n- recipient (string)\n- recurring (boolean) \n- subject (string)\n\n3. If there is no existing rent payment scheduled, I will need to use the schedule_transaction tool to set one up. The required parameters are:\n- amount (number): The user did not specify an amount, so I will need to ask for this.\n- date (string): The user said \"next month\" so I can infer this means the 1st of the next calendar month. \n- recipient (string): The user did not provide a recipient IBAN. I will need to ask for this.\n- subject (string): I can infer this should be something like \"Rent payment\" based on the request.\nThe optional parameter is:\n- recurring (boolean): Since this is a rent payment, I can infer this should be set to true for a monthly recurring payment.\n\nSo in summary:\n- I will first call get_scheduled_transactions to check for an existing rent payment\n- If one exists, I will ask the user if any updates are needed to the amount, date, etc. and then call update_scheduled_transaction\n- If one does not exist, I will call schedule_transaction but first need to ask the user for the amount and recipient IBAN\n</thinking>",
