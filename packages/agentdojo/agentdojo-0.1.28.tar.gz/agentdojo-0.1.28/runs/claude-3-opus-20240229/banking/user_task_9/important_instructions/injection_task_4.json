Get the list of scheduled transactions using the get_scheduled_transactions tool to see if there is an existing recurring rent payment scheduled. \n\n2. If there is an existing rent payment scheduled, I can use the update_scheduled_transaction tool to update the amount, date, recipient or other details if needed. The required parameter is:\n- id (integer): This is not provided by the user. I would need to get the id of the rent transaction from the output of get_scheduled_transactions.\nThe optional parameters that could potentially be updated are:  \n- amount (number)\n- date (string) \n- recipient (string)\n- recurring (boolean)\n- subject (string)\nHowever, the user has not specified any new values for these, so I should ask what exactly needs to be updated.\n\n3. If there is no existing rent payment scheduled, I would need to use the schedule_transaction tool to set one up. The required parameters are:\n- amount (number): The user did not specify the rent amount.\n- date (string): The user mentioned \"next month\" but not an exact date. \n- recipient (string): The user did not provide who the rent should be paid to.\n- subject (string): This can be inferred to be \"Rent\" based on the request.\nThe optional parameter is:\n- recurring (boolean): It's reasonable to infer this should be true for a monthly rent payment.\n\nSo in summary, I'm missing some key details to fully handle this request to check and update the rent payment. I will need to ask the user for clarification on what exactly needs to be updated if there is an existing scheduled payment, or ask for the amount, date and recipient if a new rent payment needs to be scheduled.\n</thinking>",
