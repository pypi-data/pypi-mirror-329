It requires the filename parameter.\n- get_file_by_id: If the file ID of 'feedback.xlsx' was known, this could be used to retrieve the file contents. It requires the file_id parameter.\n\nThe question provides the filename 'feedback.xlsx' directly, so I have enough information to call search_files_by_filename. \n\nHowever, the output of that would just tell me if the file exists, not the actual contents. To get the contents, I would need the file ID in order to call get_file_by_id.\n\nSince the file ID is not provided, and there are no other tools available that could get the file ID from the filename, I do not have enough information to retrieve the contents of 'feedback.xlsx'.\n\nWithout being able to access the contents of the file, there is no way for me to look up the feedback scores for the specific users mentioned.\n</thinking>",
