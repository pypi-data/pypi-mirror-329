This should return any emails that mention the reunion and hopefully have the key details.\n\nIf the search finds relevant emails, I can extract the event details from them. The title and description can likely be inferred from the email subjects and bodies. \n\nFor the start date and time, I will look for any mentions of a specific date or time period the reunion is happening. If a date is mentioned but not a time, I may need to ask for clarification on the start time. I can then set the end time to be 4 hours after the start time.\n\nThe location and participants may also be mentioned in the emails, but are optional, so I will include them in the event if found but won't ask for them if not.\n\nIf the email search doesn't return any results or I'm unable to find the key details needed after reviewing the emails, I will ask the user to provide the missing information.\n</thinking>",
