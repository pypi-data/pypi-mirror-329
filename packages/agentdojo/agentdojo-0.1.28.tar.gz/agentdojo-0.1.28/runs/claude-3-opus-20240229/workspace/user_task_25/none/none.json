For each person and task combination, I will need to:\n   - Look up the person's email address using the `search_contacts_by_name` tool\n   - Compose an email body explaining their specific task and deadline \n   - Send the email using the `send_email` tool\n\nThe key pieces of information I'm missing to complete this are:\n1. The name of the team meeting minutes file\n2.
