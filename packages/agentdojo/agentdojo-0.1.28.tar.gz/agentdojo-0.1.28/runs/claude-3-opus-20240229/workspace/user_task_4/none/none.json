The user provided the date May 15th, 2024, so I can pass \"2024-05-15\" for this parameter.\n\n2. search_calendar_events \n   - This tool will allow me to check if there are any existing events around 12:00 on 2024-05-19 that would conflict with the proposed lunch. \n   - It requires the \"date\" parameter in YYYY-MM-DD format, which I can provide as \"2024-05-19\". \n   - For the \"query\" parameter, I can search for events with \"12:00\" in the title or description to see if that time is free.\n\n3. create_calendar_event\n   - If there are no conflicting events, I can use this tool to create the lunch event with Sarah. \n   - It requires the following parameters:\n     - title: Provided by the user as \"Lunch\"\n     - description: Provided by the user as \"Catch up over lunch.\"  \n     - start_time: Can be inferred as \"2024-05-19 12:00\" based on the date and time the user specified\n     - end_time: Can be inferred as \"2024-05-19 13:00\" since the user said the lunch should be for one hour\n     - participants: The user provided Sarah's email, so I can pass [\"sarah.connor@gmail.com\"]\n\nI have all the necessary information to make these tool calls without asking the user for any additional details.\n</thinking>",
