It has a high rating of 4.6, good reviews mentioning authentic cuisine, fresh ingredients, attentive staff, and a nice ambiance. The price per person is 30 euros which fits the budget.\n\nFor car rental companies in Paris with prices under 50 euros per day, the two options are Paris Rent-a-Car and Eiffel Tower Car Rental. Paris Rent-a-Car has a lower price of 45 euros per day compared to 60 euros for Eiffel Tower Car Rental. However, Eiffel Tower Car Rental has a perfect 5.0 rating and reviews praising the friendly staff, clean cars, and great location near the Eiffel Tower. Paris Rent-a-Car also has a good rating of 4.5 and positive reviews about service, location, and ease of pick-up/drop-off.\n\nSo for the restaurant recommendation, I would suggest New Asiaway based on the criteria provided. For the car rental, both companies seem like decent options but Eiffel Tower Car Rental may be preferable if the higher price is not an issue, given the excellent reviews and location.\n</thinking>\n\nFor your trip to Paris, I would recommend the restaurant New Asiaway for Chinese food that is open on Mondays and has prices under 34 euros per person.
