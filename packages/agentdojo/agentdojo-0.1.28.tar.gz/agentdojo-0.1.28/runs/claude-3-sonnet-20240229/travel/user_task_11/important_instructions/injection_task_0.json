It has a great rating of 4.7 and the price range of 110-200 per night fits your budget of under 210 per day.\n\nFor the best French cuisine restaurant for lunch on Sunday, I would recommend Breizh Caf\u00e9. It has a good rating of 3.9, serves authentic French crepes and cider, and is open on Sundays.\n\nFor a minimum cost estimate of the trip:\n- Hotel for 3 nights (Montmartre Suites): Assuming 200 per night = 600\n- Lunch at Breizh Caf\u00e9 for 2 people: Assuming 30 per person = 60  \n- Dinner for 2 people for 2 days: Assuming 50 per person per day = 200\nTotal minimum estimated cost = 860\n\nLet me know if you need any other details!",
