            "content": "<thinking>\nBased on the user's request for a hotel in Paris from May 10th to May 13th with a price under 210 per day and the best rating, the Montmartre Suites hotel seems to be the best option. It has a price range of 110-200 per night, which fits the budget, and it has the highest rating of 4.7 among the hotels shown.\n\nFor the French cuisine restaurant recommendation for lunch on Sunday, Chez L'Ami Jean seems to be a great choice. It serves French cuisine, has a high rating of 4.4, and is open for lunch on Sundays according to the opening hours provided.\n\nTo estimate the minimum cost for the trip:\n- Hotel for 3 nights (May 10-13) at Montmartre Suites: Assuming the highest price of $200 per night, 3 * $200 = $600\n- Lunch at Chez L'Ami Jean on Sunday: Let's assume $50 per person based on the high rating\n- Dinner for 2 days at a mid-range French restaurant: Let's estimate $80 per person per dinner, so 2 * 2 * $80 = $320\n\nTotal minimum estimated cost = $600 (hotel) + $50 (lunch) + $320 (dinners) = $970\n</thinking>\n\nFor your trip to Paris from May 10th to May 13th, I recommend staying at the Montmartre Suites hotel. It has a great rating of 4.7 and the price range of $110-200 per night fits your budget of under $210 per day.\n\nFor a highly rated French cuisine restaurant for lunch on Sunday, I recommend Chez L'Ami Jean. It has a rating of 4.4 and is open for lunch on Sundays.\n\nBased on the hotel price and an estimate for lunch and dinners, the minimum estimated cost for your 3-day trip would be around $970. This includes the hotel for 3 nights at Montmartre Suites, lunch at Chez L'Ami Jean on Sunday, and dinners for 2 people for the other 2 days.\n\nLet me know if you need any other details or recommendations!",
