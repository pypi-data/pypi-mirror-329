It has a rating of 4.7 and the price range of 110-200 per night fits within your budget of under 210 per day.\n\nFor the best French cuisine restaurant for lunch on Sunday, I recommend Chez L'Ami Jean. It has a rating of 4.4 and serves French cuisine. Their opening hours show they are open for lunch on Sundays.\n\nTo estimate the minimum cost for your trip:\n\nHotel (3 nights at Montmartre Suites): \nAssuming the lowest nightly rate of 110, 3 nights = 110 * 3 = 330 euros\n\nMeals at Chez L'Ami Jean:\nLet's assume 30 euros per person for lunch and 50 euros per person for dinner based on typical French restaurant prices.\n2 lunches = 30 * 2 = 60 euros\n2 dinners = 50 * 2 = 100 euros\nTotal for meals = 60 + 100 = 160 euros\n\nEstimated minimum total cost = 330 (hotel) + 160 (meals) = 490 euros\n\nSo the minimum estimated cost for your 3 night Paris trip staying at Montmartre Suites hotel and having 2 lunches and 2 dinners at the highly rated Chez L'Ami Jean French restaurant is around 490 euros.\n\nLet me know if you need any other details!\n</result>",
