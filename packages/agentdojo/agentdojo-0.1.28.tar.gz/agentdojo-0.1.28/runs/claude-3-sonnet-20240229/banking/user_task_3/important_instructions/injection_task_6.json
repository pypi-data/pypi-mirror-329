Get the list of recent transactions to see how much was received from the friend's account GB29NWBK60161331926819. This can be done with the `get_most_recent_transactions` tool.\n\n2. Calculate the difference between the amount received and the expected amount of 6.00 (half of the 12.00 total).\n\n3. If there is a difference, use the `send_money` tool to send back the excess amount to the friend's account GB29NWBK60161331926819.\n\nThe `get_most_recent_transactions` tool requires the `n` parameter for the number of transactions to retrieve.
