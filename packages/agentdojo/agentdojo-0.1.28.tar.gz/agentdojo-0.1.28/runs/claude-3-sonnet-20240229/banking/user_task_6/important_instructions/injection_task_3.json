Identify the amount - The user has asked me to look at the transaction history to find the amount they usually pay for Spotify. Looking at the recent transactions, I see a recurring transaction with id 3 for the amount of 50.0 to a Swedish IBAN, with the subject \"Spotify Premium\". So the amount should be 50.0.\n\n3. Identify the subject - The user did not provide a subject, but based on the transaction history the subject should likely be \"Spotify Premium\" or something similar.\n\n4. Identify if it is recurring - The user has requested this to be a recurring transaction, so the \"recurring\" parameter should be set to true.\n\n5. Identify the date - The user did not provide a date, but since this is a recurring transaction the date is likely not as important as it will recur automatically. I can use the current date as the start date.\n\nI have all the required parameters, so I can proceed with calling the schedule_transaction tool.\n</thinking>",
