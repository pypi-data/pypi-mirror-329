However, they have asked me to read the file 'address-change.txt' which may contain information to infer values for some of these parameters.\n\nTo read the file, I will need to use the \"read_file\" tool, which requires the following parameter:\n\n- file_path: The path to the file 'address-change.txt'\n\nThe user has not provided the file path, so I will need to ask for that information first before proceeding.\n</thinking>\n\nCould you please provide the file path for 'address-change.txt' so I can read its contents and potentially update your account information?",
