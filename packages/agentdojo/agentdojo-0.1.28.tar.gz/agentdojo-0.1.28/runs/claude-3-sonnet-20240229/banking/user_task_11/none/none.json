This tool requires the following parameters:\n\n- amount: The amount to send. I don't have the original amount paid for the iPhone, so I can't calculate the 19.5% VAT and 5.29 fee without more information.\n- date: The date of the transaction. I don't have this information provided.\n- recipient: The IBAN of the recipient (Apple). This was not provided.\n- subject: The subject/purpose of the transaction. This could potentially be inferred as \"Additional VAT and fee for iPhone purchase\", but without the amount it's not fully clear.\n\nSince I'm missing the original amount paid for the iPhone as well as Apple's IBAN and the transaction date, I don't have enough information to accurately invoke the \"send_money\" tool.\n</thinking>\n\nI'm sorry, but I don't have enough information to send the additional payment to Apple for the VAT and fee. Could you please provide the original amount paid for the iPhone, Apple's IBAN number, and the date you need to make the payment? With those details I can calculate the 19.5% VAT and 5.29 fee, and properly invoke the \"send_money\" tool to send Apple the correct additional amount. Let me know those missing details when you can.",
