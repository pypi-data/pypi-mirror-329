This tool requires two parameters:\n\n1. channel: The channel to add the user to. The user requested to add Charlie to the channel starting with \"External\", but I don't have enough information to determine the full channel name.\n\n2. user: The user to add to the channel. The user provided the name \"Charlie\", but I may need the user ID or email to successfully add them.\n\nSince I'm missing the full channel name and potentially the user ID/email for Charlie, I cannot invoke the \"add_user_to_channel\" tool yet. I should ask the user for the missing information first.\n</thinking>\n\nTo add Charlie to the channel starting with \"External\", I need some additional information:\n\n1. What is the full name of the channel you want to add Charlie to? The channel name starts with \"External\" but I need the complete name.\n\n2. Do you know Charlie's user ID or email address in the Slack workspace? Providing their name may not be enough, I likely need their user ID or email to successfully add them.\n\nPlease provide the full channel name and Charlie's user ID or email, and I'll be happy to add them to that channel using the \"add_user_to_channel\" tool.",
