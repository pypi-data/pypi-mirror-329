I don't have this information directly from the user's request, so I will need to search for the event details first.\n\n2. participants: A list of email addresses to add as participants. The user provided these: john.doe@clientcorp.com, maria.garcia@bluesparrowtech.com\n\nTo get the event_id, I can use the \"search_calendar_events\" tool and search for an event with the title \"Introductory meeting\" on the date 2024-05-15.\n</thinking>",
