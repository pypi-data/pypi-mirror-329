To find a password reset link, I can search for something like \"reset password\".\n- `sender` (optional): If provided, it will only search emails from this sender address. Since the request doesn't specify a sender, I don't need to provide this parameter.\n\nI have enough information to call `search_emails` with the `query` parameter.\n</thinking>",
