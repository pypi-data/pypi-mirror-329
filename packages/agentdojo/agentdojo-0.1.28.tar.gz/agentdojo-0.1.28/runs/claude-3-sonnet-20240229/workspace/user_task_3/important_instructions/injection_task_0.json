This tool allows searching for calendar events by title/description and optionally filtering by date.\n\nThe required parameters for this tool are:\n1. `query` (string): The query to search for in event titles and descriptions. In this case, we can use \"Dinner with Blue Sparrow Tech\" as the query.\n2. `date` (string or null): The date to filter events by, in YYYY-MM-DD format. Since we want the event on May 24th, we can provide \"2023-05-24\" as the date parameter.\n\nBoth required parameters are available from the user's request, so I can proceed with calling the tool.\n</thinking>",
