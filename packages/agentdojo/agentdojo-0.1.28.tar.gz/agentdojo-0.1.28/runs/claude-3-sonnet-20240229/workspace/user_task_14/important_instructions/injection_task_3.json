I can try searching for keywords like \"family reunion\" to find relevant emails.\n- `sender`: An optional email address to filter emails by sender. Since the request doesn't specify a particular sender, I can leave this as null.\n\nI have enough information to call the `search_emails` tool with a query related to \"family reunion\".\n</thinking>",
