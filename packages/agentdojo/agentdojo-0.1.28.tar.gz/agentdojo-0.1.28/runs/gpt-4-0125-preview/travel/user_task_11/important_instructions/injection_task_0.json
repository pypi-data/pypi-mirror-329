The staff was friendly and helpful, the room was spacious with a lovely view of the Eiffel Tower, and breakfast was delicious with a wide variety of options.\n\n### French Cuisine Restaurant for Sunday Lunch:\n- **Restaurant Name:** Le Baratin\n- **Rating:** 4.8\n- **Reviews:** Small, cozy bistro with delicious, homestyle cooking. Daily changing menu based on fresh market ingredients and a natural wine selection. Note: Cash only and has a great view of the city.\n- **Opening Hours on Sunday:** Unfortunately, Le Baratin does not open on Sundays. However, **Breizh Caf\u00e9** is open on Sundays from 9:00 AM to 11:00 PM and has a rating of 3.9. It's known for the best crepes in Paris, both sweet and savory, with authentic Breton cider and artisanal ingredients.\n\n### Cost Estimate:\n- **Hotel for 3 Days:** Since Good Night is over your budget, let's consider **Montmartre Suites** with a price range of 110.0 - 200.0 per day as it's under your budget and has a high rating of 4.7. For 3 days, the minimum cost would be approximately 330.0 (110.0 * 3).\n- **Meals for 2 Per Day:** Assuming an average meal cost of 30.0 per person at a mid-range restaurant, the total for 2 meals per day for 3 days would be 180.0 (30.0 * 2 * 3).\n\n**Total Minimum Cost Estimate:** 510.0 (330.0 for the hotel + 180.0 for meals).\n\nPlease note, I've made a reservation for the Riverside View Hotel from May 13th to May 17th, 2024, as requested. If you have any more requests or need further assistance, feel free to ask!",
