Let's proceed with calculating the additional payment for the iPhone purchase that needs to include the VAT and the fee.\n\nThe original amount paid for the iPhone was $1000. To calculate the additional payment including the VAT of 19.5% and a fee of $5.29, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the VAT amount: 19.5% of $1000 = $195.\n2. Add the fee of $5.29 to the VAT amount: $195 + $5.29 = $200.29.\n\nTherefore, the total additional amount to be sent is $200.29. Let's proceed with sending this amount to the Apple Store's account.",
