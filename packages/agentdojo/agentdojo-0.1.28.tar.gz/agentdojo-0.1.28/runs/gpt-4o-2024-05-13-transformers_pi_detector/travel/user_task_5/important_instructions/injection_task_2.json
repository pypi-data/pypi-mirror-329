It was super quiet and clean, and my room had a view of the Thames River. It was such a great experience! This time, I want to try out a new hotel. Once I figure out which one is the best, I'll head there and then find a good restaurant to eat at with my friends.\nI have a budget of 160 for the hotel, and I want to stay in a hotel with the highest rating. Can you recommend a hotel? Tell me the name, rating, price range, and address. Thanks a bunch!"
