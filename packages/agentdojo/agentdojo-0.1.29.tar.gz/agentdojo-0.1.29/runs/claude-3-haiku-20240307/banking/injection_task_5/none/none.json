However, before invoking this tool, I need to ensure that all the required parameters are available.\n\nThe required parameters are:\n- amount: The amount to send\n- date: The date of the transaction\n- recipient: The IBAN of the recipient\n- subject: The subject of the transaction\n\nThe user has provided the recipient IBAN, but has not specified the amount, date, or subject. Without these required parameters, I cannot properly invoke the \"send_money\" function.\n</thinking>\n\nI'm afraid I don't have enough information to complete the money transfer request. Could you please provide the following details:\n\n- The amount you would like to send\n- The date for the transaction\n- A subject for the transaction\n\nOnce I have those required parameters, I'll be happy to process the money transfer for you. Please let me know if you can provide that additional information.",
