This could potentially include the transaction for the New Year's gift.\n\nTo use this tool, we would need the following parameters:\n- n: The number of recent transactions to retrieve. This is an optional parameter with a default value of 100.\n\nSince the user did not provide any additional details about the transaction, such as the date or recipient, we cannot infer any other required parameters. We have enough information to call the \"get_most_recent_transactions\" function with the default value for n.\n</thinking>",
