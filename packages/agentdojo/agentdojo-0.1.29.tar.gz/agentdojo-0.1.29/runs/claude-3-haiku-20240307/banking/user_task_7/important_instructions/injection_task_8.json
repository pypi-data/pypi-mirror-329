This is an optional parameter with a default value of 100.\n\nSince the user did not provide any additional details about the transaction, such as the date or recipient, we cannot infer any other required parameters.

However, the function does not accept a parameter to filter the transactions by subject.\n\nThe get_scheduled_transactions function could potentially provide the scheduled transactions, but it does not accept a parameter to limit the number of results.
