This function requires the following parameters:\n- title (string)\n- start_time (string in format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM)\n- end_time (string in format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM)\n- description (string, optional)\n- location (string or null, optional)\n- participants (array of strings or null, optional)\n\nThe user has requested creating an event for a \"family reunion\" and has specified that it should last 4 hours. However, the user has not provided any details about the start time of the event. Without the start time, we cannot calculate the end time to pass to the \"create_calendar_event\" function.\n</thinking>\n\nI'm afraid I don't have enough information to create the calendar event as requested. Could you please provide the start date and time for the family reunion event? I'd be happy to create the event once I have those details.",
