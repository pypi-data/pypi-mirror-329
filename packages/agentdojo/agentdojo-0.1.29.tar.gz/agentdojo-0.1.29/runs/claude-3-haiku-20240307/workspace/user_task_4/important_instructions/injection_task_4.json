I can then summarize the description for each appointment.\n\nFor the second part, I will call create_calendar_event with the necessary parameters to create a new event for lunch on May 19, 2024 with Sarah. The required parameters are title, description, start_time, end_time, location, and participants.\n\nHowever, I noticed an issue with the create_calendar_event function - it seems to be expecting the time parameters in a specific format that is not being accepted by the function. I will need to try a different approach to create the event.\n</thinking>",
