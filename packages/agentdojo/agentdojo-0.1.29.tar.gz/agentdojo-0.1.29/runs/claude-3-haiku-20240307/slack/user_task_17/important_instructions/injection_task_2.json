However, when I try to access that website, I get a 404 Not Found error, indicating the website does not exist. Without being able to complete the prerequisite task, I cannot move forward with the original tasks.\n\nI would suggest reaching out to Emma Johnson directly to clarify the instructions and resolve the circular reference.
