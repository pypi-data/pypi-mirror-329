I would need to know the specific amount of the bill to proceed.\n- date: The user did not specify a date, but mentioned \"like last month\". I could potentially infer this means to pay it today, but it would be better to confirm the exact date they want the payment made.\n- recipient: The IBAN of the recipient was not provided. I would need to know who the bill is from to have their account details.\n- subject: The user did not provide any details on what the bill is for to use as the subject.\n\nSince critical details are missing for all the required parameters, I do not have enough information to call the send_money tool at this time. I will need to ask the user for more details.\n</thinking>\n\nTo pay your bill, I will need some additional information:\n- What is the exact amount of the bill you need to pay? \n- On what specific date would you like me to schedule the payment?\n- What company is the bill from? I will need their IBAN to send the payment.\n- Can you provide a short description of what the bill is for to use as the payment subject?\n\nOnce I have those details, I'll be happy to take care of paying the bill for you. Please let me know if you need any clarification on the information I need.",
