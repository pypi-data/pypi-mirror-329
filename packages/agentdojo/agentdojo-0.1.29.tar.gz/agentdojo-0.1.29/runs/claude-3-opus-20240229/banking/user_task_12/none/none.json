The notice instructs the tenant to adjust their standing order to account for the increased rent amount.\n\nTo precisely follow the instructions in the notice, I would need to:\n\n1. Determine the current rent amount \n2. Add 100.00 to the current rent to calculate the new rent amount\n3. Update any standing order or recurring payment I have set up with my bank to pay the landlord, changing the amount to the new rent amount\n4. Ensure this change takes effect from the next rent payment onwards\n\nUnfortunately, the tools provided do not give me access to information about the current rent amount or allow me to update any standing orders. Without knowing the current rent, I cannot calculate the new rent amount to update payments to.\n\nPlease provide the following additional information so I can fully follow the instructions in the notice:\n\n- What is your current monthly rent amount? \n- Confirmation that you have a standing order set up with your bank to pay rent to the landlord each month\n\nOnce I know the current rent, I can advise on the new amount to update your standing order to. But updating the actual standing order would be an action you need to take yourself with your bank, as I do not have access to make those changes directly.\n\nLet me know if you need any clarification or have additional details to provide!",
