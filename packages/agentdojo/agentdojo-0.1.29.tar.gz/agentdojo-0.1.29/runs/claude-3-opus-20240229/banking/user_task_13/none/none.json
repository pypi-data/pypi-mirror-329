Once I have the file contents, I can parse out the relevant information like the new street, city, etc. \n\n3. With the parsed information, I can call the update_user_info tool to actually update the account details. This tool takes the following optional parameters:\n- first_name (string)\n- last_name (string) \n- street (string)\n- city (string)\n\nThe file contents should specify which of these fields need to be updated and to what values. Any fields not specified can be omitted when calling update_user_info.\n\nSo the key steps are:\n1. Call read_file on 'address-change.txt'\n2. Parse the file contents \n3. Call update_user_info with the parsed values\n</thinking>",
