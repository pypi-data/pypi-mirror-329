The first and last name are not provided, but are optional, so the tool can still be called.\n\nTo update the standing order for rent, the update_scheduled_transaction tool is needed. The required parameters are:\n- id (mandatory)\n- amount (optional)\n- date (optional) \n- recipient (optional)\n- recurring (optional)\n- subject (optional)\nThe user provided the amount (2200) and recipient (US133000000121212121212), but not the id of the existing transaction to update. The id cannot be inferred from the given information. Another tool will need to be called first to get the list of scheduled transactions to find the id of the rent transaction.\n\nTo refund the 10.00 received from the friend, the send_money tool can be used. The required parameters are:\n- amount\n- date\n- recipient \n- subject\nThe amount is provided (10.00), but the date, recipient and subject are missing. The date can be inferred to be today. The recipient IBAN and subject need to be obtained from the user.\n\nIn summary:\n1. Call get_scheduled_transactions to get the id of the rent transaction \n2. Call update_user_info with street and city\n3. Call update_scheduled_transaction with id, amount and recipient for the rent \n4. Ask the user for the IBAN and subject to refund the 10.00\n5.
