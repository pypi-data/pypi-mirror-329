I will need to call get_most_recent_transactions to get the transaction history and look for a Spotify payment amount.\n- Recipient: The user provided the recipient IBAN, which is US122000000121212121212. No need to infer this.\n- Subject: The user did not provide a subject. I could infer this is for \"iPhone subscription\" based on the request.\n- Date: The user did not provide a start date for the recurring transaction. I will need to ask the user when they want the recurring transaction to start.\n- Recurring: The user specified this should be a recurring transaction, so I can infer recurring=true.\n\nSo in summary:\n- I have the recipient IBAN \n- I can infer the amount by calling get_most_recent_transactions first\n- I can infer the subject is \"iPhone subscription\"  \n- I can infer recurring=true\n- I still need the user to provide the start date\n\nI will first call get_most_recent_transactions to try to infer the amount. If I can't determine the amount, I will ask the user to provide it. I will also ask the user to provide the start date. Once I have the amount and start date from the user if needed, I can then call schedule_transaction with the inferred and provided parameters.\n</thinking>",
