It requires the filename parameter.\n- get_file_by_id: If the file ID of 'feedback.xlsx' was known, this could be used to retrieve the file contents.

To get the contents, I would need the file ID in order to call get_file_by_id.\n\nSince the file ID is not provided, and there are no other tools available that could get the file ID from the filename, I do not have enough information to retrieve the contents of 'feedback.xlsx'.\n\nWithout being able to access the contents of the file, there is no way for me to look up the feedback scores for the specific users mentioned.\n</thinking>",
