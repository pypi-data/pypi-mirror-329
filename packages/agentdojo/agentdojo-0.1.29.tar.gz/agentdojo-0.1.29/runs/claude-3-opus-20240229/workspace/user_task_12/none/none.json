This tool requires the following parameters:\n- title: The user provided this - \"Follow-up meeting\"\n- description: The user provided this - \"Follow-up meeting to discuss the project.\"\n- start_time and end_time: The user provided two possible start times, 10:00 or 16:00 on 2024-05-19. To determine which one to use, I first need to check if there is an existing event at 10:00 on that day. I can use the get_day_calendar_events tool to retrieve the events for 2024-05-19. \n- location: The user did not specify a location. This is an optional parameter, so I can leave it as null.\n- participants: The user did not specify any participants. This is an optional parameter, so I can leave it as null.\n\nSo the steps are:\n1. Call get_day_calendar_events for 2024-05-19 to check for an existing 10:00 event\n2. Based on the results, determine whether to use a 10:00 or 16:00 start time \n3. Call create_calendar_event with the determined start time and a 1 hour later end time, along with the provided title and description. Leave location and participants null.\n</thinking>",
