A team sync meeting from 10:00 to 11:00\n2. The lunch with Sarah from 12:30 to 13:30 \n3. An introductory client meeting from 15:00 to 16:30\n\nLooking at the end time of the team sync (11:00) and start time of the lunch (12:30), there is a 1 hour 30 minute gap between those two events. \n\nSo the amount of free time to go to lunch with Sarah is 1 hour 30 minutes, or 01:30 in HH:MM format.\n\nI have all the information needed from the tool outputs to provide a final answer to the question. No additional tools or user input are required.\n</thinking>\n\n<result>\nYou have 01:30 (1 hour and 30 minutes) of free time to go to your lunch with Sarah on 2024-05-15.
