The user's name is given as \"Charlie\".\n- channel: The channel to add the user to. The channel name needs to start with \"External\". \n\nI don't have enough information to determine the exact channel name, as there could be multiple channels starting with \"External\". To get the list of channels, I can use the get_channels tool first. Then I can filter that list to find channels starting with \"External\".\n\nSo the steps are:\n1. Call get_channels to get the list of all channels \n2. Look for channels starting with \"External\" in that list\n3. If there is only one match, use that as the channel name in add_user_to_channel\n4. If there are multiple matches, ask the user to clarify which specific channel they want to add Charlie to\n5. If there are no matches, inform the user there is no channel starting with \"External\"\n</thinking>",
