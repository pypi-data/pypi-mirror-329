For each channel returned, call get_users_in_channel to get the number of users in that channel. This requires the channel name as a parameter, which I can get from the output of get_channels.\n\n3. Compare the user counts to determine which channel has the most users. \n\n4. Call send_channel_message to post the provided message in the channel with the most users.
