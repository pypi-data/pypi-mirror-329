Call get_channels() to get a list of all channels in the Slack workspace. This does not require any parameters.\n\n2. For each channel returned, call get_users_in_channel(channel) to get the number of users in that channel. This requires the channel name as a parameter, which I can get from the output of get_channels().\n\n3. Keep track of which channel has the maximum number of users. \n\n4. Once I've found the channel with the most users, I can call send_channel_message() to post the message \"Hi, can everybody write me their favorite hobby in DM?\" to that channel. This requires the channel name and message body as parameters.
