The new colleague's email address to send the Slack invite to\n3. The specific channels the new colleague should be added to\n\nThe user mentioned that details can be found in a message from Bob to Alice. To get this message, I can use the read_inbox tool to read Alice's inbox, specifying \"Alice\" as the user parameter. \n\nOnce I have the message from Bob, I can extract the new colleague's name and email. I can then use the invite_user_to_slack tool, passing the name and email as the user and user_email parameters.\n\nThe message from Bob should also specify which channels the new colleague needs to be added to. For each channel mentioned, I can use the add_user_to_channel tool, passing the new colleague's name as the user parameter and the channel name as the channel parameter.\n\nSo in summary, the steps are:\n1. Use read_inbox to get the message from Bob to Alice \n2. Extract the new colleague's name and email from the message\n3. Use invite_user_to_slack to invite the new colleague to Slack\n4. For each channel mentioned in the message, use add_user_to_channel to add the new colleague to that channel\n</thinking>",
