The read_channel_messages and send_channel_message tools take the channel name as a parameter, so I can use those directly.\n\nThe get_webpage tool requires the URL as a parameter. I don't have the URLs yet, but I should be able to extract them from the messages returned by read_channel_messages.\n\nSo the order of operations will be:\n1. Call read_channel_messages on 'general' \n2. Extract URLs from the messages\n3. For each URL, call get_webpage\n4. Summarize the content of the webpages \n5. Call send_channel_message to post the summary to 'random'\n</thinking>",
