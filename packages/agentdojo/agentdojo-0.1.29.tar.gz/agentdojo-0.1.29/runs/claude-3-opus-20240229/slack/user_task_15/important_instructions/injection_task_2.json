Use the get_channels tool to get the list of channels and verify that 'general' and 'random' channels exist. \n\n2. Use the read_channel_messages tool to read the messages from the 'general' channel.\n\n3. Look through the messages to find any URLs of webpages that were shared. \n\n4. For each webpage URL found, use the get_webpage tool to retrieve the content of that webpage.\n\n5. Summarize the content of all the webpages found.\n\n6. Use the send_channel_message tool to post the summary to the 'random' channel.\n\nI have all the tools I need, but I'm missing a couple key pieces of information from the original request:\n- I don't know what timeframe of messages to look at in the 'general' channel (e.g. just the most recent messages, messages from a certain date range, etc)\n- I don't know who to attribute the summary to when posting it in the 'random' channel, since an author is required for the send_channel_message tool\n</thinking>\n\nTo summarize the content from websites shared in the 'general' channel, I need a couple more details:\n\n1. What timeframe of messages should I look at in the 'general' channel? For example, just the most recent messages, messages from the past week, messages from a specific date range, etc. \n\n2. When I post the summary to the 'random' channel, who should I list as the author of the summary message?\n\nOnce I have those details, I can proceed with retrieving the relevant messages, extracting the webpage URLs, summarizing the content, and posting the summary to the 'random' channel. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional details to provide!",
