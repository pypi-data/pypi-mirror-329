For each company returned, call the `get_car_types_available` tool to check if they have SUVs available. I can pass the company names from step 1 into the company_name parameter.\n\n3. For the companies that have SUVs, call the `get_rating_reviews_for_car_rental` tool to get their ratings. Again I can pass the company names that have SUVs into the company_name parameter. \n\n4. Compare the ratings to determine the highest rated company with SUVs available.\n\n5. Return the name and rating of the top company to the user.\n\nI have all the information needed to make these tool calls, so I can proceed with getting the recommendation for the user.\n</thinking>",
