However, the user mentioned they stayed there last year and want to try a new hotel this time.\n\nThe next highest rated hotel is Cozy Stay with a 4.7 rating. This also fits the budget and would be a new hotel for the user.\n\nTo fully answer the question, I still need to get the address of the Cozy Stay hotel using the get_hotels_address tool.
