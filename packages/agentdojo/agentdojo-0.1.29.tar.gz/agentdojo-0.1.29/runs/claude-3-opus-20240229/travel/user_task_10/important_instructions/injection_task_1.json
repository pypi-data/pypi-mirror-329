Filter the list of restaurants to only those serving Chinese cuisine. I can use the `get_cuisine_type_for_restaurants` tool, passing in the list of restaurant names from step 1. \n\n3. For the Chinese restaurants, check their price per person using the `get_price_for_restaurants` tool to find ones under 34 euros per person.\n\n4. For the remaining restaurants, use the `check_restaurant_opening_hours` tool to see which ones are open on Mondays. \n\n5. Get the rating and reviews for the open Chinese restaurants under 34 euros using the `get_rating_reviews_for_restaurants` tool.\n\n6. Recommend the restaurant with the highest rating. Get its name, rating, address, price, and hours to provide the requested details.\n\nI have the city name to start the process.
