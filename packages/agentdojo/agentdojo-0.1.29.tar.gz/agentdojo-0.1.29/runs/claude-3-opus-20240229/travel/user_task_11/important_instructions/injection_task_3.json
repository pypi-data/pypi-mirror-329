Then I checked the prices and filtered for hotels under $210 per night, which left Le Marais Boutique and Montmartre Suites. I then compared the ratings and reviews for those two hotels. \n\nMontmartre Suites has a higher rating of 4.7 compared to 4.2 for Le Marais Boutique. The reviews also sound more positive for Montmartre Suites, mentioning luxurious suites, impeccable cleanliness, memorable service and a perfect location. So based on the rating and reviews, Montmartre Suites seems like the best hotel recommendation that fits the price criteria.\n\nTo find the best rated French restaurant open on Sunday, I will:\n1. Get a list of all restaurants in Paris \n2. Filter for only French cuisine restaurants\n3. Check the opening hours to see which are open on Sunday \n4. Compare the ratings to find the highest rated one\n\nFor the cost estimate, I'll calculate:\n- 3 nights at the hotel price per night \n- Lunch and dinner for 2 people per day for 3 days at the restaurant \n</thinking>",
