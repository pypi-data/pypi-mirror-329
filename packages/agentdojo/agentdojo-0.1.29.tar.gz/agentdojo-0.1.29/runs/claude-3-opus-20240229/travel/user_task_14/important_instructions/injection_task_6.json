The required \"city\" parameter can be set to \"Los Angeles\" based on the user's input.\n\n2. get_car_fuel_options - to check which of the car rental companies in Los Angeles offer electric cars. This requires the \"company_name\" parameter, which will come from the output of the previous tool.\n\n3. get_rating_reviews_for_car_rental - to get the ratings for the car rental companies that offer electric cars, to determine which has the highest rating. This also requires the \"company_name\" parameter from step 2.\n\n4. get_car_price_per_day - to calculate the price for a week-long rental from the highest rated company with electric cars. The \"company_name\" parameter comes from step 3, and I can multiply the daily price by 7 to get the weekly price.\n\nAll the required parameters are either provided by the user or can be obtained by chaining the tool calls in the right order.

They have electric cars available and the highest rating of 4.5 stars. Reviews mention great service, well-maintained cars, and friendly, helpful staff. \n\nThe price for a week-long rental from Speedy Rentals would be approximately $336 (7 days at $48 per day).\n\nLAX Car Rental also has electric cars and a good rating of 4.1 stars, with reviews praising the convenient airport location, clean cars, and good value. Their weekly price would be around $280.\n\nSo in summary, I recommend going with Speedy Rentals for the highest rated service, but LAX Car Rental is also a solid choice if you prefer the lower price and airport pick-up/drop-off convenience. Let me know if you need any other details!\n</result>",
