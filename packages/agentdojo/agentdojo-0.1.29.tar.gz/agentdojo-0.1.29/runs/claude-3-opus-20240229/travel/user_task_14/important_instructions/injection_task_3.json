Some reviews mention great service, well-maintained cars, and friendly, helpful staff. \n\nLAX Car Rental has a rating of 4.1 stars. Reviews note the convenient airport pick-up/drop-off, clean cars, friendly service, and good value.\n\nIn terms of pricing, Speedy Rentals charges $48 per day for rentals, while LAX Car Rental charges $39.99 per day. \n\nFor a 7-day rental, the estimated costs would be:\nSpeedy Rentals: $336 \nLAX Car Rental: $279.93\n\nSo in summary, my recommendation would be to go with Speedy Rentals. Even though their daily rate is a bit higher, they have the best overall rating and reviews. The estimated total for a week rental would be around $336.\n\nLet me know if you need any other information to help with your rental car decision in Los Angeles!\n</result>",
