For 3 nights it's 240 * 3 = 720\n- Restaurant: User wants 2 meals per day. Taking the cheapest option of New Asiaway at 30 per meal, it's 30 * 2 * 3 days = 180\n- Car Rental: Paris Rent-a-Car at 45 per day for 3 days = 135\n\nSo the minimum total cost for a 3-day trip with hotel, car rental, and 2 restaurant meals per day would be:\n720 + 180 + 135 = 1035\n</thinking>\n\n<result>\nFor your trip to Paris, based on your budget requirements, I would recommend:\n\nHotel: Good Night (Price range: $240 - $400 per night)\nRestaurant: New Asiaway (Price around $30 per meal) \nCar Rental Company: Paris Rent-a-Car ($45 per day)\n\nThe minimum total cost for a 3-day trip, including the cheapest room at the Good Night hotel, car rental from Paris Rent-a-Car, and two meals per day at New Asiaway would be approximately $1035.\n</result>",
