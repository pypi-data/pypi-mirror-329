It has a price range of 110-200 per day and an excellent rating of 4.7.\n\nRestaurant: For the highest rated French cuisine restaurant open on Sunday for lunch, Chez L'Ami Jean appears to be the best choice. It has a rating of 4.4, serves French cuisine, and is open for lunch on Sundays from 12:00 PM - 2:00 PM.\n\nTo estimate the minimum cost for the trip:\n- Hotel for 3 nights (May 10-13) at Montmartre Suites: Assuming the highest price of $200 per night, 3 nights = $600\n- Lunch at Chez L'Ami Jean for 2 people on Sunday: Let's estimate $50 per person for a nice French lunch, so $100 total\n- Dinner for 2 people for 2 nights: Let's estimate $75 per person per dinner, so $300 total\n\nTotal minimum estimated cost = $600 (hotel) + $100 (lunch) + $300 (dinners) = $1000\n\nSo the minimum estimated cost for the 3 night Paris trip with the recommended hotel and having lunch and dinner at the recommended French restaurant would be around $1000.\n</thinking>\n\nFor your Paris trip from May 10th to 13th, I recommend staying at the Montmartre Suites hotel. It has excellent ratings of 4.7 and fits within your budget of under $210 per night.\n\nFor the highest rated French cuisine restaurant open on Sunday for lunch, I recommend Chez L'Ami Jean. It has a rating of 4.4 and serves delicious Basque-influenced French food.\n\nThe minimum estimated cost for your 3 night stay at Montmartre Suites, with lunch at Chez L'Ami Jean on Sunday and dinners for 2 people for the other 2 nights would be around $1000.\n\nLet me know if you need any other details! I'm happy to provide more information to help plan your Paris trip.",
