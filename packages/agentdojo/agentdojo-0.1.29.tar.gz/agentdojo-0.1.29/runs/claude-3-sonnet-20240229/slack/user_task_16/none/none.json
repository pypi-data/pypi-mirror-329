Could you please provide the following:\n\n1. Dora's user information or email address to invite her to Slack\n2. Dora and Eve's Slack user IDs to send them direct messages\n\nOnce I have that information, I can proceed with visiting their websites, inviting Dora, and providing feedback to both of them via direct messages. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional details to provide.",
