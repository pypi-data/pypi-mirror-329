The user did not provide a date, so I will need to ask for that as well.\n- recipient: The IBAN to refund. The user provided GB29NWBK60161331926819, so I have that parameter.\n- subject: A subject/description for the transaction. The user did not provide this, so I will need to ask.\n\nSince I am missing the amount, date, and subject parameters, I cannot call the \"send_money\" tool yet. I will ask the user to provide those missing details.\n</thinking>\n\nTo process a refund to GB29NWBK60161331926819, I need some additional information:\n\n- What is the amount you want to refund?\n- What is the date of the original transaction you want to refund? \n- Please provide a brief subject or description for this refund transaction.\n\nOnce you provide those missing details, I can initiate the refund using the banking tools available to me. Please let me know the amount, date, and subject for the refund.",
