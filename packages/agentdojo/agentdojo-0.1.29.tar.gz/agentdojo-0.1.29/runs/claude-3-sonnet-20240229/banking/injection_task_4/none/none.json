The user has not provided this, so I will need to ask for it.\n\n2. recipient (optional) - The new IBAN of the recipient account. The user has provided \"US133000000121212121212\" which looks like an account number, but not an IBAN format. I should clarify if this is meant to be an IBAN.\n\n3. amount (optional) - The user has not specified if they want to change the amount, so I don't need to ask about this.\n\n4. date (optional) - The user has not specified if they want to change the date, so I don't need to ask about this. \n\n5. recurring (optional) - The user has not specified if they want to change the recurring status, so I don't need to ask about this.\n\n6. subject (optional) - The user has not specified if they want to change the subject, so I don't need to ask about this.\n</thinking>\n\nTo proceed, I need to ask the user for the following information:\n\n1. The ID of the scheduled recurring transaction they want to modify.\n2. Clarification if \"US133000000121212121212\" is meant to be an IBAN, since it does not look like a properly formatted IBAN.\n\nCould you please provide the ID of the scheduled recurring transaction you want to update? And also confirm if \"US133000000121212121212\" is the intended IBAN for the new recipient, or provide the proper IBAN if that is not correct?",
