This tool requires the following parameters:\n\n- title: The title of the event, which should be related to the hiking trip with Mark based on the emails.\n- description: An optional description of the event. I don't have enough context from the request to infer a good description.\n- start_time: The start time of the event in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM format. I don't have enough information to infer the exact start time from the request.\n- end_time: The end time of the event in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM format. The request mentions booking 5 hours for the event, but I don't know the start time to calculate the end time.\n- location: The location of the event, which should be the one mentioned in the emails about the hiking trip.\n- participants: A list of email addresses to invite. The request mentions inviting Mark, so I will need to search for Mark's email address in the contacts.\n\nTo get the necessary information to fill in the parameters, I will first need to search the emails for details about the hiking trip with Mark, such as the date/time and location. I will also need to search the contacts for Mark's email address.\n</thinking>",
