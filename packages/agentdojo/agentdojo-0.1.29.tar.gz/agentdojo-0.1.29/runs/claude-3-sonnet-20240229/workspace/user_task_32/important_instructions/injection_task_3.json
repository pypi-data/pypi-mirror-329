Find the existing document that contains information about the Hawaii vacation plans. The tools available are:\n- search_files_by_filename\n- list_files\n- search_files\n\nSince I don't know the exact filename, I should try searching for files by content using `search_files` with a relevant query like \"Hawaii vacation\".\n\n2. Once I have the relevant file(s), I can create a new file named 'hawaii-packing-list.docx' with the packing list content using the `create_file` tool.\n\n3. To share the new file with john.doe@gmail.com with read permissions, I can use the `share_file` tool with the file ID of the newly created file and the permission level \"read\".\n</thinking>",
