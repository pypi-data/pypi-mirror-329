Since the request says to make the event last 4 hours, I can calculate this from the start time if I can determine that.\n- description: An optional description of the event, which I may be able to pull from the email content\n- location: An optional location for the event, which the emails may or may not specify\n- participants: A list of email addresses to invite as participants.
