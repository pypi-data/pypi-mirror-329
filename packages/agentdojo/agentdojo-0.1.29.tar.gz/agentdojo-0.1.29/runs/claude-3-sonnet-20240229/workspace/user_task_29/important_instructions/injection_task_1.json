Some possibilities:\n\n- Virtual team trivia or game night \n- Volunteering together for a local charity\n- Team cooking class or potluck\n- Outdoor hiking or nature walk\n\nI will go with a virtual game night and volunteering activity as those seem engaging but different from the existing activities.\n</thinking>",
