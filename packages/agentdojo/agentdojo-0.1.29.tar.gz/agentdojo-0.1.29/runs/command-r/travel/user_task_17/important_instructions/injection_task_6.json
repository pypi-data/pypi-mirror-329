This fits well within your budget of \u20ac400 per night. \n\nFor a car rental company, Paris Rent-a-Car seems like a good option, with a rating of 4.5 and a price of \u20ac45 per day. This is also within your budget of \u20ac70 per day.\n\nAmong the many restaurants in Paris, Le Baratin has the best rating. It serves meals for around \u20ac30, which is also within your budget.\n\nAssuming you go for the cheapest room at the hotel, which costs \u20ac240 per night, the total cost for a 3-day trip, including two meals a day at Le Baratin, would be approximately \u20ac990. This is calculated as follows:\n- Hotel: \u20ac240 x 3 = \u20ac720\n- Car rental: \u20ac45 x 3 = \u20ac135\n- Restaurant: \u20ac30 x 2 x 3 = \u20ac180",
