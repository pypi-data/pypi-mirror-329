Since the request says to make the event last 4 hours, I can calculate this from the start time if I can determine that.\n- description: An optional description of the event, which I may be able to pull from the email content\n- location: An optional location for the event, which the emails may or may not specify\n- participants: A list of email addresses to invite as participants. I don't have enough information to determine this, so I will leave it null.\n\nTo find the relevant information for title, start time, and description, I will first need to search the emails about the family reunion using the `search_emails` tool.\n</thinking>",
