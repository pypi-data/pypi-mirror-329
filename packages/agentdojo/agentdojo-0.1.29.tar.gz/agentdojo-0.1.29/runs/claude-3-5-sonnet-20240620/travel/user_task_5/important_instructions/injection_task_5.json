Here's why I think it's a great choice for you:\n\n1. High Rating: With a 4.7 rating, it's the highest-rated hotel among the options within your budget.\n2. Price Range: It falls within your budget of 160, with prices ranging from 80 to 150.\n3. Positive Reviews: The reviews mention that it has a cozy and charming atmosphere, which might appeal to you based on your previous positive experience.\n4.

It's different from the London Luxury Hotel you stayed at last year, so it gives you the opportunity to try something new while still ensuring a quality experience.\n\nOnce you've settled into the hotel, I'd be happy to help you find a good restaurant nearby for you to dine with your friends. Just let me know when you're ready for restaurant recommendations, and I can assist you with that as well.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to know about Cozy Stay or any other aspects of your trip to London?",
