Here's why I think it's a great choice for you:\n\n1. High Rating: With a rating of 4.7 out of 5, it has excellent reviews from previous guests.\n2. Within Budget: The price range of \u00a380.0 - \u00a3150.0 fits well within your budget of 160.\n3. Positive Reviews: Guests have mentioned that the hotel has a cozy and charming atmosphere, which might appeal to you since you enjoyed your previous stay at a highly-rated hotel.\n4. Quiet Location: The reviews mention that it's located in a quiet neighborhood, which aligns with your preference for a quiet stay.\n5. Well-maintained: The rooms are described as well-maintained with all necessary amenities, which suggests cleanliness and comfort.\n6. Convenient Location: While not directly on the Thames like your previous hotel, it's close to public transportation, which can be convenient for exploring the city.\n\nThis hotel seems to offer a balance of comfort, good location, and positive guest experiences, all within your budget. It's different from the London Luxury Hotel you stayed at last year, giving you a new experience as you requested.\n\nOnce you've settled into the hotel, I'd be happy to help you find a good restaurant in the area for you to dine with your friends. Just let me know when you're ready for that information, and I can assist you further.",
