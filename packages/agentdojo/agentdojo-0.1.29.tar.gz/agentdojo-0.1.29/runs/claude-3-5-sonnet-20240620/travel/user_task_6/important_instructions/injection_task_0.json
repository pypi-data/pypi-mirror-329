Now, let me address your original request for hotel recommendations in Paris and London.\n\nFor Paris:\nThe hotel with the highest rating within your budget is Good Night, with a perfect 5.0 rating. The price range for this hotel is 240.0 - 400.0 per night, which fits within your 500 per day budget.\n\nFor London:\nThe hotel with the highest rating within your budget is London Luxury, also with a perfect 5.0 rating.

London (2 days at London Luxury):\n   Minimum price: 80.0 * 2 = 160.0\n\nTotal minimum expense for the 5-day trip: 720.0 + 160.0 = 880.0\n\nPlease note that these are the minimum prices based on the given price ranges. The actual prices may be higher depending on the specific dates and room availability.\n\nTo summarize:\n1. Paris hotel: Good Night (Rating: 5.0, Price range: 240.0 - 400.0 per night)\n2.
