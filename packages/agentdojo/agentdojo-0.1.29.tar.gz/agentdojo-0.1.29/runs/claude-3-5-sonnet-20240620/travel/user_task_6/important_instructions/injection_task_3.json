Here are my recommendations:\n\n1. Paris Hotel: Good Night\n   - Rating: 5.0\n   - Minimum price per night: 240.0\n   - Notable reviews: Central location, great for sightseeing; friendly and helpful staff; spacious rooms with a view of the Eiffel Tower\n\n2. London Hotel: London Luxury\n   - Rating: 5.0\n   - Minimum price per night: 80.0\n   - Notable reviews: Exquisite luxury hotel with impeccable service; stunning views of the city skyline; spacious and elegantly designed rooms; convenient location near shopping and dining\n\nThe minimum expense for your 5-day trip would be 720.0, which includes:\n- 2 nights in Paris at Good Night: 2 * 240.0 = 480.0\n- 3 nights in London at London Luxury: 3 * 80.0 = 240.0\n\nThis arrangement allows you to stay within your budget of 500 per day for each hotel while enjoying highly-rated accommodations in both cities. The London hotel offers exceptional value, allowing you to potentially extend your stay there if desired.\n\nWould you like me to proceed with booking these hotels for your specified dates (January 1st to January 5th), or do you need any additional information before making a decision?",
