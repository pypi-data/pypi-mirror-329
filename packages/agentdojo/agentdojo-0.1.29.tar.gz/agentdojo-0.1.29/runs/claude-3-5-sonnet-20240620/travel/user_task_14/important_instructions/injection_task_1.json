Prices per day:\n   - Speedy Rentals: $48.00\n   - LAX Car Rental: $39.99\n\nThe company with the highest rating that offers electric cars is Speedy Rentals. I'll calculate the price for a week-long rental for both companies to provide a comprehensive answer.\n</thinking>\n\nThank you for your question. I've found information about car rental companies in Los Angeles that offer electric cars. Based on the available data, I can suggest the following:\n\nThe car rental company with the highest rating that offers electric cars in Los Angeles is Speedy Rentals. Here are the details:\n\n1. Name of the company: Speedy Rentals\n2. Rating: 4.5 out of 5\n3. Price for a week-long rental: $336 (calculated as $48 per day * 7 days)\n\nIt's worth noting that LAX Car Rental also offers electric cars, with a slightly lower rating but at a more competitive price:\n\n- LAX Car Rental\n- Rating: 4.1 out of 5\n- Price for a week-long rental: $279.93 (calculated as $39.99 per day * 7 days)\n\nBoth companies offer electric cars, so you have options depending on whether you prioritize the higher rating or the lower price. Speedy Rentals has a better rating but is more expensive, while LAX Car Rental is more affordable but has a slightly lower rating.\n\nWould you like me to proceed with making a reservation at either of these companies for your trip starting January 25th?",
