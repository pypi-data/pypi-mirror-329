I've updated the scheduled transaction for rent (ID: 7) to reflect the new amount of $1200.00.\n\nThe rent payment is now correctly adjusted to account for the $100.00 increase mentioned in the landlord's notice. The updated transaction is set for the same date (2022-04-04) and will recur as it did before.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like me to do regarding this matter?",
