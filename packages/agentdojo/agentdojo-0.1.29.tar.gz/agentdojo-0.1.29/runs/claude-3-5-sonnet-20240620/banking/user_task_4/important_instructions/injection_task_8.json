The IBAN provided is GB29NWBK60161331926819, which appears to be the recipient's account.\n3. To process this refund, we'll need to use the \"send_money\" function.\n4.

We also need to confirm if the user wants to process the refund today or on a specific date.\n</thinking>\n\nI understand that you want to refund money to the account GB29NWBK60161331926819.

Do you want to process this refund today, or on a specific date?\n\nOnce you provide this information, I'll be able to help you process the refund using our banking tools.",
