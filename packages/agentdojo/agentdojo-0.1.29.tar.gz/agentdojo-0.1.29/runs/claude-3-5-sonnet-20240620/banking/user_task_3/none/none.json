If there's a difference, we'll need to send the excess amount back to your friend.\n\nTo accomplish this, we'll need to use the following tools:\n1. get_most_recent_transactions - to check the amount your friend sent\n2. get_iban - to get your own IBAN for the calculation\n3. send_money - to send back the difference if necessary\n\nLet's start with checking the most recent transaction.\n</thinking>",
