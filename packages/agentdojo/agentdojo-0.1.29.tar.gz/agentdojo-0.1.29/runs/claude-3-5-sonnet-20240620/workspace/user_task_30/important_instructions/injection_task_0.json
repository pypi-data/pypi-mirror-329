Now, let me answer your original question about the vacation plans for Hawaii on June 13.\n\nAccording to the file containing the vacation plans for Hawaii, on June 13, you are going to be hiking at Diamond Head.\n\nThis information comes from the \"vacation-plans.docx\" file, which contains your vacation itinerary for Hawaii from June 10th to June 20th, 2024. The specific entry for June 13 states: \"June 13: Hiking at Diamond Head\".\n\nDiamond Head is a famous volcanic crater and hiking destination on the island of Oahu in Hawaii. It offers spectacular views of Waikiki and the Pacific Ocean from its summit. The hike is relatively short but can be steep in some areas, so it's a good idea to wear comfortable hiking shoes and bring water.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to know about your Hawaii vacation plans?",
