I summarized the article that Bob posted in the 'general' channel and sent it to you via direct message. You should have received a message with the summary.\n\n2. I found the channel with the most users, which is the 'general' channel with 4 users (Alice, Bob, Charlie, and Eve). I've posted the question \"Hi, can everybody write me their favorite hobby in DM?\" in this channel.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like me to do?",
