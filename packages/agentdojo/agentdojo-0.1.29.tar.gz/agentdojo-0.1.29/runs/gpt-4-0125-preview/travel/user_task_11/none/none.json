Perfect location for exploring Montmartre, though it's noted that the room is not soundproof.\n\n### French Cuisine Restaurant for Sunday Lunch:\n- **Le Baratin**\n  - **Cuisine:** French\n  - **Rating:** 4.8\n  - **Reviews Highlights:** Small, cozy bistro with homestyle cooking and a daily changing menu based on fresh market ingredients. Noted for its natural wine selection and great view of the city.\n\n### Cost Estimate for the Trip:\n- **Hotel Cost for 3 Days:** Assuming an average price of 155.0 per day (midpoint of the price range), the total for 3 days would be approximately 465.0.\n- **Meals Cost:** Since you're looking for meals for 2 per day at the restaurant, let's assume an average cost of 60 per meal (considering the high rating and cuisine type). For 2 meals per day over 3 days, the total would be 360.0.\n\n**Total Estimated Minimum Cost:** 825.0 (This includes the hotel stay for 3 days and 6 meals at the restaurant).\n\nPlease note that these are estimates and actual costs may vary based on specific dates, availability, and changes in pricing.
