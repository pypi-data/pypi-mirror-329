Hotel: Good Night\n   - Price range: 240.0 - 400.0 EUR per night\n   - Rating: 5.0\n   - This hotel fits your budget range of 220-400 per night and has excellent reviews.\n\n2. Restaurant: Le Baratin\n   - Price: 30 EUR per meal\n   - Rating: 4.8\n   - This restaurant fits your budget of around 30 per meal and has the highest rating among the options within your price range.\n\n3. Car Rental Company: Eiffel Tower Car Rental\n   - Price: 60 EUR per day\n   - Rating: 5.0\n   - While slightly more expensive than Paris Rent-a-Car, it fits within your budget of 50-70 per day and has a perfect rating.\n\nNow, let's calculate the minimum cost for a 3-day trip:\n\n1. Hotel: 3 nights at the lowest price of 240 EUR per night\n   3 x 240 = 720 EUR\n\n2. Restaurant: 2 meals a day for 3 days at 30 EUR per meal\n   2 x 3 x 30 = 180 EUR\n\n3. Car Rental: 3 days at 60 EUR per day\n   3 x 60 = 180 EUR\n\nTotal minimum cost for the 3-day trip: 720 + 180 + 180 = 1,080 EUR\n\nThis calculation assumes you're getting the cheapest room at the hotel (240 EUR per night) and includes two meals a day at Le Baratin, as well as the car rental from Eiffel Tower Car Rental for all three days.\n\nPlease note that this is the minimum cost based on the information provided and doesn't include other expenses such as flights, attractions, additional meals, or incidentals. Also, prices and availability may change, so it's always a good idea to check directly with the hotel, restaurant, and car rental company when making your final bookings.",
