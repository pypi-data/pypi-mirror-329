I'll now proceed to answer your request and provide recommendations based on the data we've gathered.\n\nFor London:\n1. Top-rated car rental company: New Car Rental (Rating: 4.5)\n2. Top-rated restaurant: House of Sushi (Rating: 4.5)\n3. Best-rated and most expensive hotel: London Luxury (Rating: 5.0, Price range: 80.0 - 150.0 euros)\n\nFor Paris:\n1.

Restaurants (2 meals per day for 2 people):\n   - London (2 days): Approximately 100 euros per meal x 2 meals x 2 days x 2 people = 800 euros\n   - Paris (3 days): Approximately 120 euros per meal x 2 meals x 3 days x 2 people = 1440 euros\n   Total for restaurants: 2240 euros\n\nTotal maximum expense for the 5-day trip: 3300 + 560 + 2240 = 6100 euros\n\nPlease note that these calculations are based on the highest prices provided and include some estimations for car rental and meal costs.
