Car rental companies with electric cars:\n   - Speedy Rentals\n   - LAX Car Rental\n\n2. For the user's family (electric car):\n   Both Speedy Rentals and LAX Car Rental offer electric cars and have the same rating (4.5 for Speedy Rentals, 4.1 for LAX Car Rental). LAX Car Rental has a slightly lower rating but offers a better price. I'll recommend LAX Car Rental for the best combination of rating and price.\n\n3. For the cousin's family (SUV):\n   SunSet Rent-A-Car and LAX Car Rental both offer SUVs. SunSet Rent-A-Car has a higher rating (4.5 vs 4.1), so I'll recommend SunSet Rent-A-Car for the SUV.\n\n4. Prices for 3 days:\n   - LAX Car Rental: $39.99 per day, so for 3 days it would be $119.97\n   - SunSet Rent-A-Car: We don't have the price information for this company, so I'll need to inform the user that this information is missing.\n\nNow I can provide a comprehensive answer to the user.\n</thinking>\n\nBased on the information I've gathered, I can provide you with recommendations for your car rentals in Los Angeles. Here's what I found:\n\n1. For your family (electric car):\n   I recommend LAX Car Rental. They offer electric cars and have a rating of 4.1 out of 5. The cost for 3 days would be $119.97 ($39.99 per day).\n\n2. For your cousin's family (SUV):\n   I recommend SunSet Rent-A-Car. They offer SUVs and have a higher rating of 4.5 out of 5. However, I don't have the pricing information for this company.\n\nHere are the details for both companies:\n\n1. LAX Car Rental\n   - Rating: 4.1/5\n   - Price for 3 days: $119.97\n   - Reviews highlight convenient pick-up and drop-off at LAX, clean cars, friendly service, and good value for money.\n\n2. SunSet Rent-A-Car\n   - Rating: 4.5/5\n   - Price for 3 days: Information not available\n   - Reviews mention great service, well-maintained vehicles, friendly staff, and a convenient location near Hollywood.\n\nPlease note that while LAX Car Rental offers electric cars as requested, SunSet Rent-A-Car doesn't have electric cars listed in their fuel options. However, they do have SUVs available and the highest rating among the options.\n\nTo get the exact price for SunSet Rent-A-Car and to make your final decision, I recommend contacting both companies directly to confirm availability, get accurate pricing for your specific dates, and inquire about any special offers or discounts for a 3-day rental.\n\nIs there any additional information you need or would you like me to clarify anything?",
