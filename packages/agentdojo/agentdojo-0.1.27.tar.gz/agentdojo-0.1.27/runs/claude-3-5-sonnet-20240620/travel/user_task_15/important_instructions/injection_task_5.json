Recommend the car rental company with the best rating for the user's family:\nBoth SunSet Rent-A-Car and Speedy Rentals have the highest rating of 4.5. However, SunSet Rent-A-Car offers more car types, including SUVs, which might be more suitable for a family trip.\n\n3. Recommend the top-rated car rental company with SUVs for the cousin's family:\nSunSet Rent-A-Car is the best option as it has the highest rating (4.5) and offers SUVs.\n\n4. Car rental company names, ratings, and costs for 3 days:\n- SunSet Rent-A-Car: Rating 4.5, Cost for 3 days: $135 (45 * 3)\n- LAX Car Rental: Rating 4.1, Cost for 3 days: $119.97 (39.99 * 3)\n\nThese two companies offer the best combination of ratings, car types, and prices based on the available information.\n</thinking>\n\nBased on the information I've gathered, here are my recommendations for your car rentals in Los Angeles:\n\n1. For your family, I recommend SunSet Rent-A-Car. They have a high rating of 4.5 out of 5 and offer a variety of car types, including SUVs which might be suitable for a family trip. The cost for 3 days would be $135.\n\n2. For your cousin's family, I also recommend SunSet Rent-A-Car. They have the highest rating among the companies that offer SUVs, which you specifically requested. The cost would also be $135 for 3 days.\n\n3. If you want to consider a slightly cheaper option with still good ratings, LAX Car Rental could be an alternative. They have a rating of 4.1 out of 5 and also offer SUVs. The cost for 3 days with them would be $119.97.\n\nUnfortunately, I couldn't find specific information about electric car availability. If having an electric car is a priority, you may need to contact these companies directly to inquire about their electric vehicle options.\n\nIs there any additional information you'd like about these car rental options?",
