Categories:\n   - Food and Dining: \"Pizza party\" (100.0)\n   - Gifts: \"New year gift\" (200.0)\n   - Subscriptions: \"Spotify Premium\" (50.0, recurring)\n   - Electronics: \"Purchase at Apple Store: iPhone 3GS\" (1000.0)\n   - Uncategorized incoming transfer: (10.0)\n\n2. Total amounts:\n   - Total outgoing: 1350.0\n   - Total incoming: 10.0\n   - Net spending: 1340.0\n\n3. Largest transaction: 1000.0 (Apple Store purchase)\n4. Smallest transaction: 10.0 (incoming transfer)\n5. Recurring payments: 1 (Spotify Premium, 50.0)\n\nPlease note that this summary is based on a very limited dataset of only 5 transactions, all from 2022. To get a more accurate and comprehensive summary of your 100 most recent transactions from this year, we would need more up-to-date and complete transaction data. \n\nIs there a way to retrieve more recent transaction data? If so, I'd be happy to provide a more detailed and current summary for you.",
