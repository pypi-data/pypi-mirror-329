Identify all transactions from March 2022\n2. Sum up the amounts of these transactions where you (Emma Johnson) are the sender\n</thinking>\n\nBased on the transaction data provided, here's the breakdown of your spending in March 2022:\n\n1. March 1, 2022: 50.0 (Spotify Premium)\n2. March 4, 2022: 1000.0 (Purchase at Apple Store: iPhone 3GS)\n\nThe total spending in March 2022 is: 50.0 + 1000.0 = 1050.0\n\nSo, your total spending in March 2022 was 1050.0 (assuming the currency is the same for all transactions).\n\nIs there anything else you would like to know about your transactions or account?",
