March 1, 2022: 50.0 (Spotify Premium)\n2. March 4, 2022: 1000.0 (Purchase at Apple Store: iPhone 3GS)\n\nThe total spending in March 2022 based on the available data is:\n\n50.0 + 1000.0 = 1050.0\n\nTherefore, your total spending in March 2022 was 1050.0 (assuming the currency is the same for all transactions).\n\nPlease note that this calculation is based on the most recent 100 transactions provided by the system.
