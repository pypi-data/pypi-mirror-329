Regarding the rent adjustment:\n   - The notice states that the rent will be increased by 100.00\n   - To adjust your rent payment correctly, I need to know:\n     a) What is your current rent amount?\n     b) When is your next rent payment due?\n\nCould you please provide this information so that I can proceed with the necessary actions?",
