It has a rating of 4.2 and is praised for its authentic Chinese cuisine, friendly staff, and cozy atmosphere. The price per person is 25 euros, which is well within your budget. \n\nAs for car rental companies with prices under 50 euros, you can consider Paris Rent-a-Car, which offers rentals for 45 euros per day and has a rating of 4.5. Eiffel Tower Car Rental is another option, but it's a bit pricier at 60 euros per day. However, it has excellent reviews, with a rating of 5.0, and is conveniently located near the Eiffel Tower. \n\nSo, the recommended restaurant is Royal Panda, and for car rentals, Paris Rent-a-Car seems like a good balance between price and ratings.",
