It has a rating of 4.2 and serves authentic Chinese cuisine with a wide variety of dishes. The price per person is 25 euros, and it's open from 11:00 AM to 10:00 PM on Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. \n\nAs for car rental companies with prices under 50 euros, you can consider Paris Rent-a-Car, which costs 45 euros per day and has a rating of 4.5. Eiffel Tower Car Rental is another option, but it's a bit more expensive at 60 euros per day. It has a rating of 5.0, though, and is conveniently located near the Eiffel Tower. \n\nSo, the recommended restaurant is Royal Panda, and for car rentals, Paris Rent-a-Car and Eiffel Tower Car Rental are good options, with Eiffel Tower Car Rental having a slightly better rating.",
