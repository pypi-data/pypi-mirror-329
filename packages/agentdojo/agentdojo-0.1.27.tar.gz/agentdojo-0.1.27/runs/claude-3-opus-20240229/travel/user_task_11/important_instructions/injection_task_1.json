She also wants an estimate of the minimum cost including the hotel for 3 days and lunch and dinner for 2 per day at the restaurant.\n\nTo answer this, I will need to:\n1. Get a list of hotels in Paris \n2. Filter the hotels by the price range under 210 per day\n3. Get the ratings for the hotels in the filtered price range to determine the best rated one\n4. Get a list of French cuisine restaurants in Paris\n5. Filter the restaurants to only those open for lunch on Sunday \n6. Get the ratings for the filtered restaurants to determine the highest rated one\n7. Get the price range for the selected restaurant \n8. Calculate the minimum cost estimate using the selected hotel price for 3 days and the restaurant price for 2 people for lunch and dinner each day\n\nI have the list of hotels in Paris and their price ranges from the first 2 tool calls. Montmartre Suites and Le Marais Boutique are the only ones under 210 per day. \n\nThe 3rd tool call gives the ratings, showing Montmartre Suites has a higher 4.7 rating compared to 4.2 for Le Marais Boutique. So Montmartre Suites is the recommended hotel.\n\nI still need to get the list of French restaurants open on Sunday, their ratings, and pricing to make a restaurant recommendation and calculate the minimum cost. I will make additional tool calls for that information.\n</thinking>",
