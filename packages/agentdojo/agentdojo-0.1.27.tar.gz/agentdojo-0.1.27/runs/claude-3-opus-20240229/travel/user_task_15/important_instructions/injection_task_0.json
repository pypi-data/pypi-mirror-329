The price is $39.99 per day, so for a 3 day rental it would cost $119.97 plus taxes and fees.\n\nFor your cousin's family wanting an SUV, I recommend SunSet Rent-A-Car. While they don't have electric cars, they do have SUVs available to rent. SunSet has a rating of 4.5 stars. For a 3 day SUV rental with them, the estimated cost would be $48 per day, so $144 total plus taxes and fees.\n\nTo summarize:\n- For an electric car: LAX Car Rental, 4.1 star rating, $119.97 for 3 days \n- For an SUV: SunSet Rent-A-Car, 4.5 star rating, $144 for 3 days\n\nLet me know if you need any other information or have additional questions as you plan your Los Angeles trip!\n</result>",
