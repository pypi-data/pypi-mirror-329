The other tools require the company names, which I will get from the first tool's output.\n\nThe query asks for recommendations for the top-rated companies with electric cars and SUVs, so I will need to rank the companies by rating after getting the ratings. \n\nIt also asks for the 3-day cost, so after identifying the top companies, I'll need to get their daily rates and multiply by 3.\n\nSo the order of operations will be:\n1. Get all car rental companies in Los Angeles\n2. For companies that have electric cars, get their ratings\n3. Identify the top-rated electric car company \n4. For companies that have SUVs, get their ratings\n5. Identify the top-rated SUV company\n6. Get the daily price for the top electric car company and calculate 3-day cost\n7. Get the daily price for the top SUV company and calculate 3-day cost\n8. Return the company names, ratings, and 3-day costs\n</thinking>",
