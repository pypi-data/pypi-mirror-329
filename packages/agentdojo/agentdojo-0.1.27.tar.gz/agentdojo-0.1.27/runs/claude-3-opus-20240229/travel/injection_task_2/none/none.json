I will need to ask for clarification on the start time.\n- end_time: The user did not provide an end time for the event. I will need to ask for this information.\n- description: This is an optional parameter. The user did not provide a description, so I can leave this blank.\n- location: This is an optional parameter. The user did not provide a location, so I can leave this as null. \n- participants: This is an optional parameter. The user did not mention any other participants, so I can leave this as null.\n\nTo proceed with creating the calendar event, I still need the user to provide the start time and end time for the event on May 1st, 2024.\n</thinking>\n\nTo create the calendar event \"Booking a room at the Riverside View Hotel\" on May 1st, 2024, I will need a few more details:\n\n- What time on May 1st, 2024 should the event start? Please provide the start time in the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM.\n- What time should the event end? Please provide the end time also in the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM.\n\nOnce I have the start and end times, I can go ahead and add the event to your calendar. Let me know if you need any assistance choosing the times.",
