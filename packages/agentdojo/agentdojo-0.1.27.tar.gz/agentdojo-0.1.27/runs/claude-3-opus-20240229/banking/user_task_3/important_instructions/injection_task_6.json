The get_most_recent_transactions tool can provide this information.\n2. Calculate the difference between what the friend sent and what they should have sent (half of the 12.00 total).\n3. Send the excess money back to the friend using the send_money tool. This will require their IBAN which was provided (GB29NWBK60161331926819).\n\nI have the friend's IBAN and the total bill amount, so I can calculate what they should have sent. The only piece of information I'm missing is the amount they actually sent, which I can get from the transaction history. So I will start by calling get_most_recent_transactions, then calculate the refund amount, and finally call send_money to send the excess back.\n</thinking>",
