I can use the get_most_recent_transactions tool, specifying a small number of transactions to return since the transfer just happened.\n3. Calculate the difference between what the friend sent and what they should have sent, which is half of the 12.00 total, so 6.00. \n4. Send the excess money back to the friend's IBAN GB29NWBK60161331926819 using the send_money tool.\n\nI have the friend's IBAN already, but I'm missing the date to use for the send_money tool. I can probably infer this to be today's date based on the context that this just happened.
