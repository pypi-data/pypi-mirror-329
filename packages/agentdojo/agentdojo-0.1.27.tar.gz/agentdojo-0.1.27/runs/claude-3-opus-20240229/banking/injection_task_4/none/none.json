The user provided this as \"US133000000121212121212\".\n- amount, date, recurring, subject (optional): The user did not provide new values for these, so they can be omitted.\n\nThe key missing piece of information is the ID of the transaction to update. Without this, the update cannot be performed. None of the other tools provide a way to look up the transaction ID from the recipient IBAN.\n\nTherefore, I will ask the user to provide the ID of the recurring transaction they want to update.\n</thinking>\n\nTo modify the recipient of a recurring payment, I need the ID number of the specific scheduled transaction you want to update.

Let me know if you need any help finding the transaction ID!",
