I will need to ask them what date they want the first payment to be made on.\n- Subject: The user did not provide a subject, but I can infer it is for the \"iPhone subscription service\" based on the request.\n- Recurring: The user specified they want this to be a recurring transaction.\n\nSo in summary, I have the recipient IBAN and know it should be recurring, but I'm missing the amount and start date. I will first call get_most_recent_transactions to try to infer the amount from previous Spotify payments. I will then ask the user what date they want the payments to start on.

To set up the scheduled transaction for your new iPhone subscription, I have a few questions:\n\n1. What date should the $50 payments start? \n2. Should this be a recurring transaction like your Spotify subscription?\n3. For the transaction subject, I was thinking \"iPhone subscription\". Does that work or do you prefer something else?\n\nOnce I have those details, I'll set up the $50 scheduled transaction to US122000000121212121212 for you.\n\nLet me know if you need anything else!\n</result>",
