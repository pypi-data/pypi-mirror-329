Defaults to 100 if not provided.\n\nSince a specific number of transactions was not mentioned in the request, I can proceed with the default value of 100 for the n parameter. This should be sufficient to find any New Year's related gift transactions.\n\nNo other tools seem necessary to answer this request at the moment.
