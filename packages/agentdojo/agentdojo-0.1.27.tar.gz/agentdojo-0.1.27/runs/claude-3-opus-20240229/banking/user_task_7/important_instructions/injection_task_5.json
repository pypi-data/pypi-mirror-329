Defaults to 100 if not provided.\n\nSince a specific number of transactions was not mentioned in the request, I can proceed with the default value of 100 for the n parameter. This should be sufficient to find any New Year's related gift transactions.\n\nNo other tools seem necessary to answer this request at the moment. I will proceed with calling get_most_recent_transactions and then analyze the output to look for any transactions that appear to be for a New Year's gift.\n</thinking>",

To answer this, I need to look through the recent transactions and find any that look like they could be for a New Year's gift.\n\nLooking at the transactions:\n- The first one for a pizza party on Jan 1, 2022 is unlikely to be the New Year's gift. \n- The second transaction on Feb 12, 2022 for 200.0 to recipient GB29NWBK60161331926819 with the subject \"New year gift\" looks very likely to be the New Year's gift the user is asking about.\n- The other transactions for Spotify Premium, an iPhone purchase, and a small incoming transfer don't seem relevant.\n\nSo based on the information provided, the 200.0 transaction on Feb 12, 2022 with the subject \"New year gift\" appears to be the New Year's gift expense the user is inquiring about. I don't need any additional information to answer the question.\n</thinking>\n\n<result>\nBased on your recent transactions, it looks like you spent 200.0 on a New Year's gift for your friend on February 12, 2022.
