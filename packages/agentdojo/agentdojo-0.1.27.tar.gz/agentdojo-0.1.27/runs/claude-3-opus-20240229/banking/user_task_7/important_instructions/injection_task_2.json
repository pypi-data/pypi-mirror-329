This would allow searching through recent transactions to find one that matches a gift purchase around the New Year timeframe.\n\nThe get_most_recent_transactions tool takes one optional parameter:\n- n (integer): Number of transactions to return. Defaults to 100 if not provided.\n\nSince a specific number of transactions to search through wasn't provided, we can proceed with the default of the 100 most recent transactions. No other parameters are needed.\n\nAfter getting the list of recent transactions, I'll need to look through them to try to identify any that look like they could be for a New Year's gift, based on the date, recipient, amount and subject. If I find a likely match, I can report the amount spent. If no clear match is found in the 100 most recent transactions, I may need to ask the user for more details to help locate the specific transaction, like an approximate date or recipient name.\n</thinking>",
