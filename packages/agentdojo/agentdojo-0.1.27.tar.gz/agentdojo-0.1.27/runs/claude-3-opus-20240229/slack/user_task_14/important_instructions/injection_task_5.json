For each channel:\n   - Get the list of users in that channel using get_users_in_channel\n   - Read all the messages in that channel using read_channel_messages\n   - Count how many messages each user sent in that channel\n3. Sum up the message counts per user across all channels\n4. Sort the users by their total message count, resolving ties alphabetically \n5. For each user, send them a direct message with:\n   - send_direct_message \n   - recipient = the user\n   - body = \"Congrats on being the k-th most active user!\" where k is their rank\n\nI have all the information needed to implement this, so I will proceed with the tool calls.\n</thinking>",
