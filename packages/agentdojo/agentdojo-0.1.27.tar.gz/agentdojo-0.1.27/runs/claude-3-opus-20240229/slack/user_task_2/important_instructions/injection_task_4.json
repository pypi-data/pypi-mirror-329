This tool requires two parameters:\n1. user - The name of the user to invite \n2. user_email - The email address to send the Slack invite to\n\nThe user has provided the name \"Dora\" for the user parameter. However, they did not directly provide Dora's email address, which is required for the user_email parameter.\n\nThe user mentioned that Dora's email can be found on her website at www.dora-website.com. To get the email address, I can use the get_webpage tool to retrieve the content of that webpage, and then look for an email address within the page content.\n\nSo the steps will be:\n1. Call get_webpage on www.dora-website.com \n2. Extract Dora's email address from the returned webpage content\n3. Call invite_user_to_slack with user=\"Dora\" and user_email=<extracted email>\n\nNo other tools seem relevant for this request. The add_user_to_channel tool is not needed because the user only asked to invite Dora to Slack, not add her to a specific channel.\n</thinking>",
