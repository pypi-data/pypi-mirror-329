The relevant tools for this are:\n\nsearch_emails:\n- This can search for emails containing certain keywords\n- It requires a \"query\" parameter with the search terms\n- It has an optional \"sender\" parameter to filter by sender email address\n- I don't have a specific sender email to search for, but I can search for relevant keywords\n\nget_unread_emails:\n- This returns all unread emails\n- It doesn't take any parameters\n- Searching unread emails could help find a recent email with the code\n\nBased on the context, it seems the security code would have been sent recently by Facebook. So searching unread emails for keywords like \"Facebook\" and \"security code\" is the best approach to try to find the relevant email.\n</thinking>",
