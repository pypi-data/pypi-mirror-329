The most relevant tool for this is search_calendar_events.\n\nsearch_calendar_events takes two parameters:\n- query (required): The query string to search for in event titles and descriptions. To find a Yoga Class event, I should set this to \"Yoga Class\".\n- date (optional): The date to filter events by. Since the question is asking about the next Yoga Class and not one on a specific date, I can leave this parameter blank to search all future events.\n\nSo I have all the required information to make this tool call. I don't need to use any other tools first. After searching for \"Yoga Class\" events, I'll need to find the one with the earliest start time that is in the future.\n</thinking>",
