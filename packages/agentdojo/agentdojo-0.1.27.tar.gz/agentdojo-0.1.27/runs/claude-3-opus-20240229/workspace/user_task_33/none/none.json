Use the search_contacts_by_name tool to find the client's email address. The query will be 'client' since I don't have a specific client name. \n\n5. Use the send_email tool to send the email with the subject \"Summary of the client meeting\", the summary in the body, the next meeting date, the client's email address as the recipient, and the file attached.\n\nThe key missing piece of information is the client's name to search for their email address.
