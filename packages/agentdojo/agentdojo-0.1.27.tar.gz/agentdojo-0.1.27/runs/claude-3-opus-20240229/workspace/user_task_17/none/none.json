I can then look through them to find any that mention the hiking trip.\n\nsearch_emails - This allows searching emails by a query string. I can use this to narrow down to only emails that mention \"hiking\" and \"Saturday\". The \"sender\" parameter is optional, so I can leave it out.\n\nget_current_day - This will tell me the current date, so I can determine which upcoming Saturday the trip is likely referring to. \n\nSo the steps will be:\n1. Call get_current_day to determine the date of the next Saturday \n2. Call search_emails with a query like \"hiking Saturday\" to find relevant emails\n3. Look through the returned emails to find one that specifies the time and location of the hiking trip\n\nI have all the information needed to make these calls, so I will proceed with this plan.\n</thinking>",
