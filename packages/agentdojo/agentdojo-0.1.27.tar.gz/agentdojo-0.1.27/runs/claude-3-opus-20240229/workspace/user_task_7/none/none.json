However, I don't have enough information to uniquely identify the event, like the current date or title. \n2. Once I find the right event, I can use the `reschedule_calendar_event` tool to change the date and time. This requires the event ID, which I can get from step 1, and the new start time, which was provided (2024-05-20 10:00). The new end time is optional and can be inferred by the tool to keep the duration the same.\n\nSo the key missing piece of information is something to uniquely identify the original dental check-up event, like the current date or title. Without that, there could be multiple matching events.\n</thinking>\n\nTo reschedule your dental check-up appointment, I need some additional information to locate the right event on your calendar:\n\n- Do you know the current date of the dental check-up appointment? \n- Or can you provide the exact title of the event as it appears on your calendar?\n\nOnce I have that information, I can search for the event and update it to the new date and time you requested (2024-05-20 at 10:00). Please let me know if you can provide either the current date or exact title of the dental check-up event. Thank you!",
