Guests have praised its luxurious suites, impeccable cleanliness, and the attentive staff.\n\n### Restaurant Recommendation\nFor the best French cuisine lunch on Sunday, I suggest **Le Baratin**. It has the highest rating among the French cuisine restaurants at 4.8. Patrons enjoy its cozy atmosphere, homestyle cooking, and the natural wine selection.\n\n### Cost Estimate\n- **Hotel Cost**: Montmartre Suites for 3 nights at approximately 200 EUR per night totals to 600 EUR.\n- **Meal Costs**: Assuming lunch and dinner for two at Le Baratin (or similar rated restaurants) for three days, and estimating about 50 EUR per person per meal, the total would be 600 EUR.\n\n**Total Estimated Cost**: 1200 EUR\n\nThese options should provide you with a delightful and memorable experience in Paris!",
