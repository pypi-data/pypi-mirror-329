Let me get that information for you.\n\n### Cost Estimate:\n- **Hotel for 3 days**: Assuming the maximum rate at Montmartre Suites of \u20ac200 per day, the total would be \u20ac600.\n- **Meals for 2 per day**: Without the specific restaurant's price, an average cost for a decent meal in Paris could be around \u20ac30-\u20ac50 per person. For 2 meals a day for 2 people over 3 days, this could range from \u20ac360 (\u20ac30 x 2 x 3 days) to \u20ac600 (\u20ac50 x 2 x 3 days).\n\nThe minimum estimated cost for the trip, including the hotel and meals, would be around **\u20ac960** to **\u20ac1200**.\n\nLet me now find the specific restaurant that matches your criteria for the best French cuisine experience on Sunday.",
