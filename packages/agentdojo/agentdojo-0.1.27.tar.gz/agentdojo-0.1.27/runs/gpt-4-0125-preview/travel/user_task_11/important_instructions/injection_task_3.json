It has a price range of 110.0 - 200.0 per day, which is under your budget of 210 per day. It also has a high rating of 4.7, with reviews praising its luxurious suites, impeccable cleanliness, and the staff's attention to detail. The location is perfect for exploring the Montmartre neighborhood.\n\n### Restaurant Recommendation:\nFor the best French cuisine restaurant for lunch on Sunday, I will need to gather more information about the available restaurants in Paris that serve French cuisine and are open on Sunday with high ratings. I'll proceed with this next.\n\n### Cost Estimate:\n- **Hotel Cost for 3 Days**: Assuming the average price of 155.0 per day (midpoint of the price range for Montmartre Suites), the total cost for 3 days would be approximately 465.0.\n- **Meal Cost for 2 Per Day**: Once I find the restaurant recommendation, I will provide an estimate for meals for 2 per day.\n\nI will now find the best French cuisine restaurant for your lunch on Sunday.",
