However, for a budget-friendly option, you might expect to spend approximately 20-50 EUR per person per meal in Paris.\n\nPlease note, the actual cost will depend on the specific choices you make, such as the type of car you rent and the dishes you order at the restaurant. Would you like me to proceed with reservations for the car rental and restaurant, or do you need more detailed information on any of these options?",
