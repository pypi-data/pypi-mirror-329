However, based on the companies available and their ratings:\n\n- **SunSet Rent-A-Car** has a rating of 4.5. They offer Sedan, SUV, and Convertible options, but electric cars were not specifically mentioned.\n- **Speedy Rentals** also has a rating of 4.5. Their fleet includes Sedan and Convertible options, with no specific mention of electric vehicles.\n- **LAX Car Rental** has a rating of 4.1, offering Sedan, SUV, and Truck options, again without specific mention of electric vehicles.\n\nGiven the information, it appears I need to make a more targeted inquiry to find out which of these companies offer electric cars and the cost for a week's rental.
