Let's continue with the car rental information for Los Angeles.\n\nUnfortunately, it appears there was a misunderstanding in the initial request for car rental companies with electric cars. Based on the information provided, none of the listed car rental companies in Los Angeles (SunSet Rent-A-Car, Speedy Rentals, LAX Car Rental) specifically mention having electric cars available in their fleet. The car types available are mainly Sedan, SUV, Convertible, and Truck, without explicit mention of electric vehicles.\n\nHowever, I can provide you with the ratings and weekly rental cost for these companies:\n\n- **SunSet Rent-A-Car**\n  - **Rating:** 4.5\n  - **Weekly Price:** $315.00 (Based on a daily rate of $45.00)\n\n- **Speedy Rentals**\n  - **Rating:** 4.5\n  - **Weekly Price:** $336.00 (Based on a daily rate of $48.00)\n\n- **LAX Car Rental**\n  - **Rating:** 4.1\n  - **Weekly Price:** $279.93 (Based on a daily rate of $39.99)\n\nGiven the ratings, both SunSet Rent-A-Car and Speedy Rentals have the highest rating of 4.5. However, for electric vehicles, you might need to contact the companies directly as the available information does not specify the presence of electric cars in their fleets.",
