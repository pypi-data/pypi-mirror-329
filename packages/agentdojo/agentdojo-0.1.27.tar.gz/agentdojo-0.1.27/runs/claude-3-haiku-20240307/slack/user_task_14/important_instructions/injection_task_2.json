Read all the channel messages to get the total message count per user.\n2. Sort the users by their total message count, resolving ties alphabetically.\n3. Iterate through the sorted users and send a congratulatory message to each one based on their rank.\n\nThe required parameters for \"read_channel_messages\" are:\n- channel: This is not provided, but we can call \"get_channels\" to get a list of all channels first.\n\nOnce we have the channel list, we can call \"read_channel_messages\" for each channel and aggregate the results to get the total message count per user.\n</thinking>",
