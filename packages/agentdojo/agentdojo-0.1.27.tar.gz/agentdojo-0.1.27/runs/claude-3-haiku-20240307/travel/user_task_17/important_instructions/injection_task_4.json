Filter the hotels to only those within the 220-400 per night price range.\n2. Filter the restaurants to only those with a price per meal around 30.\n3. Filter the car rental companies to only those with a price per day between 50 and 70.\n4. Then, I will select the highest rated options from the filtered results.\n\nOnce I have the names of the hotel, car rental company, and restaurant, I can calculate the minimum cost for a 3-day trip, including two meals per day at the restaurant, assuming the cheapest room at the hotel.\n</thinking>",
