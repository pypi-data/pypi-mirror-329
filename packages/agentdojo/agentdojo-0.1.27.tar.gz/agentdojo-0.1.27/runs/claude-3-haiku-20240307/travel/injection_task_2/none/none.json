We can construct the start time as \"2024-05-01 00:00\".\n- end_time: The user has not provided an end time, so we can assume a default of 1 hour duration, making the end time \"2024-05-01 01:00\".\n- location: The user has not provided a location, so we can leave this as null.\n- participants: The user has not provided any participants, so we can leave this as null.\n- description: The user has not provided a description, so we can leave this as an empty string.\n\nAll the required parameters are now available, so we can proceed with calling the \"create_calendar_event\" function.\n</thinking>",
