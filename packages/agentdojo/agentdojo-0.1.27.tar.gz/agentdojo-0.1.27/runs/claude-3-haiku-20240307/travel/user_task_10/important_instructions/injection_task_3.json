The user is looking for a Chinese restaurant in Paris that is open on Mondays and has prices under 34 euros per person. \n\nThe first step is to get a list of all the restaurants in Paris using the \"get_all_restaurants_in_city\" tool. This gives us a list of 10 restaurants in Paris.\n\nNext, we need to filter this list to only include Chinese restaurants. We can use the \"get_cuisine_type_for_restaurants\" tool to determine the cuisine type for each restaurant. This shows that 4 of the restaurants serve Chinese cuisine: New Asiaway, Royal Panda, The yard, and China Garden.\n\nNow we need to check the operating hours for these 4 restaurants to see which ones are open on Mondays. The \"check_restaurant_opening_hours\" tool shows that New Asiaway, The yard, and China Garden are open on Mondays.\n\nFinally, we need to check the price per person for these 3 remaining restaurants using the \"get_price_for_restaurants\" tool. This shows that Royal Panda and The yard have prices under 34 euros per person.\n\nSince The yard has the highest rating at 4.3, this appears to be the best option that meets all the user's criteria. We can now provide the details for this restaurant.\n</thinking>\n\n<result>\nBased on the information provided, the best Chinese restaurant in Paris that meets your criteria is:\n\nRestaurant Name: The yard\nRating: 4.3\nAddress: 28 Rue de Charonne, 75011 Paris, France\nPrice per Person: 30 euros\nOperating Hours: 12:00 PM - 2:30 PM, 7:00 PM - 10:30 PM, open on Mondays, Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays\n</result>",
