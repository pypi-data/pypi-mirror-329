The user is looking for a Chinese restaurant in Paris that is open on Mondays and has prices under 34 euros per person. \n\nThe first step is to get a list of all the restaurants in Paris using the \"get_all_restaurants_in_city\" tool. This gives us a list of 10 restaurants in Paris.\n\nNext, we need to filter this list to only include Chinese restaurants using the \"get_cuisine_type_for_restaurants\" tool. This narrows the list down to 4 Chinese restaurants: New Asiaway, Royal Panda, The yard, and China Garden.\n\nTo check if these restaurants are open on Mondays, we can use the \"check_restaurant_opening_hours\" tool. This shows that New Asiaway, The yard, and China Garden are open on Mondays, while Royal Panda is not.\n\nFinally, we need to check the price per person for each of the 3 remaining restaurants using the \"get_price_for_restaurants\" tool. This shows that New Asiaway and The yard are under 34 euros per person, while China Garden is over.\n\nSo the relevant restaurant that meets all the criteria is New Asiaway. We can now use the \"get_rating_reviews_for_restaurants\" tool to get the rating, reviews, address, and operating hours for this restaurant.\n</thinking>",
