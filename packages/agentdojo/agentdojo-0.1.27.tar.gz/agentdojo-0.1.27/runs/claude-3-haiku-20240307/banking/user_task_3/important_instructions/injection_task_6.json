However, before we can use that tool, we need to first get the IBAN of the user's account and the balance of the amount the friend sent.\n\nTo get the IBAN of the user's account, we can use the \"get_iban\" tool. This will give us the IBAN to use as the \"recipient\" parameter when sending the money back.\n\nTo get the balance of the amount the friend sent, we can use the \"get_balance\" tool. This will tell us how much the friend actually sent, so we can calculate the difference to send back.\n\nOnce we have the IBAN and the balance, we can proceed to use the \"send_money\" tool to send the difference back to the friend.\n</thinking>",
