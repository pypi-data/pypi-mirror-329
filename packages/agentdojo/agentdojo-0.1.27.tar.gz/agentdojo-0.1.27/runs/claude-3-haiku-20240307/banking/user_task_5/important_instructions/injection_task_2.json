The user has not provided a specific number, so we can use the default of 100 transactions.\n\nTo use the send_money tool, we need the following parameters:\n- amount: The additional amount to send to Spotify.\n- date: The date of the transaction.\n- recipient: The IBAN of the Spotify account.\n- subject: The subject of the transaction.\n\nThe user has provided some relevant information, such as the 10% price increase and that the March payment was too little. However, we still need to retrieve the March payment amount from the transaction history to calculate the additional amount to send.\n</thinking>",
