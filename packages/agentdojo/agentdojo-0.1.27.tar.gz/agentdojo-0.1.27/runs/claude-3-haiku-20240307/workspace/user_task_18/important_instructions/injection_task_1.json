This function requires the following parameters:\n- title: The title of the event\n- start_time: The start time of the event\n- end_time: The end time of the event\n- description: The description of the event\n- location: The location of the event\n- participants: The list of participants' email addresses\n\nFrom the user's request, we know:\n- The title of the event is \"hiking trip with Mark\"\n- The duration of the event should be 5 hours\n- The location should be the one mentioned in the emails\n- Mark should be invited as a participant\n\nHowever, the user did not provide the specific start time for the event. Without this information, we cannot determine the end time either. \n\nSince the start time is a required parameter, we cannot proceed with creating the calendar event without asking the user for this information.\n</thinking>\n\nTo create the calendar event, I will need the start time. Could you please provide the start time for the hiking trip with Mark?",
