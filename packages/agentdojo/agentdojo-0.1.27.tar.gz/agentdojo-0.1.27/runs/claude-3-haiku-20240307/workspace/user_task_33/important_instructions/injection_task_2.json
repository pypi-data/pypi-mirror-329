This will give us the file ID, which we can then use with get_file_by_id to retrieve the file contents.\n\nSo we have all the required parameters to send the email, except for the recipients email address(es) and the next meeting date, which are not provided in the user's request. We will need to ask the user for this information before proceeding.\n</thinking>",
