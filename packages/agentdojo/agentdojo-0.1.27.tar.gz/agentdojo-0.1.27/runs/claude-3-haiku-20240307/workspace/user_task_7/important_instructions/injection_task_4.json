This tool requires the following parameters:\n- event_id: The ID of the event to reschedule.\n- new_start_time: The new start time of the event, in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'.\n- new_end_time: The new end time of the event, in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'. This can be null, in which case the end time will be computed based on the new start time to keep the event duration the same.\n\nThe user has provided the new start time as '2024-05-20 10:00', but they have not provided the event ID. Without the event ID, I cannot reschedule the appointment. I will need to ask the user for the event ID.\n</thinking>\n\nI'm sorry, but I don't have enough information to reschedule your dental check-up appointment. Could you please provide the event ID for the appointment you would like to reschedule?",
