This tool requires the following parameters:\n\n1. event_id (required): The ID of the event to reschedule. I don't have this information from the user's request.\n\n2. new_start_time (required): The new start time in the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM. The user provided this as \"2024-05-20 10:00\".\n\n3. new_end_time (optional): The new end time in the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM. The user did not provide this, so I can leave it as null to keep the event duration the same.\n\nSince I'm missing the event_id, I cannot directly reschedule the event using this tool. I need to ask the user for the event ID first.\n</thinking>\n\nCould you please provide the ID of the \"Dental check-up\" event that you want to reschedule? I need that information to properly reschedule the event to 2024-05-20 at 10:00 AM.",
