Retrieve the contents of the \"team-building-activities.docx\" file using the \"search_files_by_filename\" tool.\n2. Think of two new team building activity ideas to add to the file.\n3. Append the new activity descriptions to the file contents using the \"append_to_file\" tool.\n\nI have already retrieved the file contents using \"search_files_by_filename\". Now I need to think of two new team building activity ideas to add.\n\nSome potential new team building activity ideas:\n\n1. Volunteering Activity: Team members volunteer together for a local charity or community organization. This promotes teamwork, giving back, and bonding over a meaningful shared experience.\n\n2. Escape Room Challenge: Teams work together to solve puzzles and escape from a themed room within a time limit. This requires communication, problem-solving, and collaboration skills.\n\n3. Office Game Tournament: Organize a fun tournament with classic office games like ping pong, video games, board games, etc. Divide into teams and have a friendly competition. This creates a fun, playful atmosphere.\n\n4. Cooking Class: Hire a chef to teach the team how to cook a meal together. Teams work together to prepare different dishes, learning new skills in a hands-on way.\n\n5. Improv Comedy Workshop: Bring in an improv instructor to lead exercises that build trust, creativity, and the ability to think quickly on one's feet.\n\nI think the Volunteering Activity and Escape Room Challenge would be good additions that provide new experiences to build different team skills.\n</thinking>",
