Find the calendar event for the lunch with Sarah on that date\n2. Get the start time of that event\n3. Subtract the current time from the start time to calculate the remaining time\n\nThe relevant tool for finding a calendar event is `search_calendar_events`. It requires two parameters:\n- `query`: I can search for \"lunch with Sarah\" to try to find the event\n- `date`: I should provide 2024-05-15 to filter events on that date\n\nI have the necessary information to call this tool.\n</thinking>",
