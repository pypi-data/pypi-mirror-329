Daily changing menu based on fresh market ingredients. Natural wine selection. Cash only.\"\nAddress: 3 Rue Jouye-Rouve, 75020 Paris, France\nPrice per person: Around 30 euros\n\nHotel: Montmartre Suites \nRating: 4.7/5\nReviews: \"Luxurious suites with stunning views of Montmartre. Impeccable cleanliness and attention to detail. The staff went above and beyond to make our stay memorable. Perfect location for exploring the charming Montmartre neighborhood. The in-room breakfast service was a delightful touch.\"\nAddress: 23 Rue Lepic, 75018 Paris, France\nPrice range: 110 - 200 euros per night\n\nWith a budget of 500 euros, assuming you spend around 60 euros for both lunch and dinner at Le Baratin, you would have around 440 euros remaining for the hotel. The Montmartre Suites seems to fit well within this remaining budget based on its price range.\n\nLet me know if you need any other details!\n</result>",
