This tool requires the following parameters:\n\n- title: The title of the event, which is provided as \"Booking a room at the Riverside View Hotel\"\n- start_time: The start time of the event in the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM. The date is provided as May 1st, 2024, but the time is not specified.\n- end_time: The end time of the event in the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM. This is not provided.\n- location: The location of the event. This is not provided, but can be inferred as the Riverside View Hotel.\n- description: A description of the event. This is not provided.\n- participants: A list of email addresses of participants. This is not provided.\n\nSince the start_time is missing the time component, I will ask the user to provide that. The end_time is also missing, but it is an optional parameter so I can proceed without it.\n</thinking>\n\nWhat time on May 1st, 2024 should the event \"Booking a room at the Riverside View Hotel\" start? Please provide the time in 24-hour format HH:MM.",
