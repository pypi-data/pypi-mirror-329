The results show that Montmartre Suites has a higher rating of 4.7 compared to 4.2 for Le Marais Boutique.\n\nSo based on the user's criteria, Montmartre Suites seems to be the best option - it is within budget and has the highest rating of the available choices.\n\nThe user also requested to add a calendar event on April 25th, 2024 to remind them to book the hotel. To do this, I will need to use the create_calendar_event tool, which requires the following parameters:\n\n- title: The title of the event \n- start_time: Start time in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM format\n- end_time: End time in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM format \n- location: Location of the event (can be null)\n- description: Description of the event (can be empty string)\n- participants: List of email addresses to invite (can be null)\n\nI have the hotel name to use in the title, and the start/end times can be set to the same date of April 25th, 2024 since it's just a reminder event.
