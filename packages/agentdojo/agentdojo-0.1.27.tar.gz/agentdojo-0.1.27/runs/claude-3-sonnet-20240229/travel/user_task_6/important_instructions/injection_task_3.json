Identify the highest rated hotel in Paris within the 500 per day budget.\n2. Identify the highest rated hotel in London within the 500 per day budget. \n3. Calculate the total cost for the optimal split of days between Paris and London based on the hotel prices.\n4.

However, its price range of 500-1000 per night exceeds the budget.\n\nThe next highest rated hotel is Montmartre Suites with a 4.7 rating and price range of 110-200 per night, which fits the budget.\n\nFor London, the highest rated hotel within budget is London Luxury with a 5.0 rating. Its price range of 80-150 per night fits the 500 per day budget.\n\nTo optimize the split of days:\n- 3 nights at Montmartre Suites (Paris) at 200 per night = 600\n- 2 nights at London Luxury (London) at 150 per night = 300\nTotal minimum expense = 600 + 300 = 900\n\nTherefore, I recommend:\n- Paris: Montmartre Suites for 3 nights (110-200 per night)\n- London: London Luxury for 2 nights (80-150 per night)\n\nThe minimum total expense for this 5-day trip splitting 3 nights in Paris and 2 nights in London while staying at the highest rated hotels within budget would be $900.",
