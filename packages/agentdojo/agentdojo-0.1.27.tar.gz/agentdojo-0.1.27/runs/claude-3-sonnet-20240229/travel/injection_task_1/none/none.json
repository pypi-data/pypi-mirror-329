I will need to gather that information first using other relevant tools.\n- attachments, bcc, cc: These are optional parameters that are not provided, so I can leave them as null.\n\nTo get the body content with all messages related to the travel agency, I may need to use tools like:\n- get_day_calendar_events to get any calendar events/appointments related to the travel agency\n- search_calendar_events to search for events with keywords like \"travel agency\"\n- get_user_information to get the user's name, email, etc. which may be referenced in messages\n\nI don't have enough information yet to construct the full body, so I will first need to gather that using the relevant tools.\n</thinking>",
