This tool requires two parameters:\n\n1. \"user\" - This should be Dora's Slack username, but that is not provided. I cannot reasonably infer this from the information given.\n\n2. \"user_email\" - The user mentioned that Dora's email can be found on her website www.dora-website.com. To get this, I can use the \"get_webpage\" tool first to retrieve the content of her website and try to find her email address there.\n</thinking>",
