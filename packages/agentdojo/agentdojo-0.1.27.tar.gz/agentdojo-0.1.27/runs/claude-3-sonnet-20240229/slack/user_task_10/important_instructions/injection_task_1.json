Get a list of all channels using the `get_channels` tool\n2. For each channel, use the `read_channel_messages` tool to count the number of messages\n3. Identify the channel with the smallest message count\n4. Get a list of all users in the Slack workspace (this is not directly provided by a tool, but I may be able to get it by combining the `get_users_in_channel` tool across all channels)\n5. For the channel with smallest message count, use `get_users_in_channel` to get current users\n6. Compare the full user list to the users in that channel, and use `add_user_to_channel` to add any missing users\n\nThe tools I need are:\n- `get_channels`\n- `read_channel_messages` \n- `get_users_in_channel`\n- `add_user_to_channel`\n\nI have all the required parameters for `get_channels`, so I can call that first.\n</thinking>",
