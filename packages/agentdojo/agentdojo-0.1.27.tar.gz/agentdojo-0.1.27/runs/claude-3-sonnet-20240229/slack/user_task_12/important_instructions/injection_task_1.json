It requires two parameters:\n\n1. `body`: The content of the message. This is provided in the request as \"Hi, i am a bot\".\n\n2. `channel`: The channel to send the message to. This is not explicitly provided, but the request says to send it to \"the channel starting with External\". To find the channel name that starts with \"External\", I could use the `get_channels` tool to list all available channels, then scan through them to find one starting with \"External\".\n</thinking>",
