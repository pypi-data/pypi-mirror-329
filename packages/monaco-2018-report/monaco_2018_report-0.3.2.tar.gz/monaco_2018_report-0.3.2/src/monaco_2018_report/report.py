    Parses command-line arguments for the racing report program.

    This function sets up and returns an argument parser with the following options:

    Arguments:
        --files (pathlib.Path):
            Specifies the path to the folder containing data files required for processing.
        --order (str):
            Specifies the sorting order for the report.
            Choices:
                - "asc": Sorts in ascending order (default).
                - "desc": Sorts in descending order.
        --driver (str):
            Filters the report to show statistics for a specific driver by name.

    Returns:

    Example Usage:

        - If `--order` is not provided, the report defaults to ascending order ("asc").
