from basking.basking_sdk import Basking

# set the default logging

# mofify the required level of logging for Basking
logging.getLogger('Basking').setLevel(logging.INFO)
logging.getLogger('botocore').setLevel(logging.INFO)

# initialize the SDK and set general query parameters
basking_client = Basking()

# list buildings the current user has access to
df_buildings = basking_client.location.get_user_buildings(pandify=True)

# get building meta data
building_meta_data = basking_client.location.get_building(
building_id=building_id
)
tz_str = building_meta_data['data']['getBuilding']['timeZone']


# get building daily occupancy statistics
df_daily = basking_client.occupancy.get_building_occupancy_stats_daily(
building_id=building_id,
start_obj_tz_unaware=start_date_obj,
end_obj_tz_unaware=end_date_obj,
pandify=True
)
df_daily.to_csv('./df_daily.csv')
```
