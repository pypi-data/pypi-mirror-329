DirScribe is a **lightweight yet powerful** CLI tool and Python library for **exporting directory structures** in either **text** or **JSON** format. It helps you **optionally** include file contents, **detect programming languages**, skip hidden items, limit file reading by size, show metadata (size and modification time), and output results directly to your terminal or a file.

## Quick Look

One of DirScribe's key features is how easily it can include file contents by extension.  
- If you run `dirscribe /path -e .py .txt`, it includes only `.py` and `.txt` files' contents.  
- **If you run `dirscribe /path -e` with no arguments, it includes *all* file contents** (new in v0.1.2).  
- If you omit `-e` entirely, no file contents are included‚Äîjust the directory tree.

Another new feature in v0.1.2 is `--clip`, which copies the final output (text or JSON) to your clipboard for quick sharing.

**Example**:
```bash
dirscribe /path/to/your_project -e .py --clip
```

This command shows all .py file contents (skipping other extensions) and copies the result to your clipboard.

Below is a quick text-based preview if you scan a sample project:

```
üìÅ your_project/
  üìÑ main.py (Python)
    def calculate_total(items):
        return sum(item.price for item in items)
    
    def main():
        print("Processing orders...")
  
  üìÅ templates/
    üìÑ index.html (HTML)
      <!DOCTYPE html>
      <html>
        <head><title>My App</title></head>
        <body><h1>Welcome</h1></body>
      </html>
    
    üìÑ style.css (CSS)
      body {
        margin: 0;
        padding: 20px;
        font-family: sans-serif;
      }
```

If you prefer JSON:

```bash
dirscribe /path/to/your_project --output-format json
```

You get:

```json
{
  "type": "directory",
  "name": "your_project",
  "path": "absolute/path/your_project",
  "children": [
    {
      "type": "file",
      "name": "main.py",
      "path": "...",
      "language": "Python",
      "content": "...",
      ...
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

## Key Features

- Text or JSON Output
  - Choose between a human-readable tree format or a structured JSON representation for advanced integrations.

- File Content Inclusion
  - Display the contents of files for specific extensions (e.g., .py, .js, .txt).
  - Tip: With v0.1.2, if you add `-e` with no extensions, all file contents are included.

- Language Detection
  - Show the programming language name (e.g., .py -> Python) alongside file names.

- Skip Hidden
  - Omit hidden files and directories (names starting with a dot).

- Maximum Size Limit
  - Automatically skip file content if a file exceeds a specified byte-size.

- Metadata Display
  - Show file size and last modification timestamp in the output.

- Clipboard Copy
  - Use `--clip` to copy the output directly to your clipboard (requires pyperclip).

- Save to File
  - Output can be redirected to a file rather than just printing to the console.

- Highly Configurable
  - Combine various options to fit your exact needs.

## Why DirScribe?

- Instant Documentation
  - Quickly generate a snapshot of your codebase ‚Äì perfect for onboarding new team members or archiving project structures.

- Efficient Code Reviews
  - Include file contents up to a specified size, letting you skim important files without diving deeply into each folder.

- Language Insights
  - Recognize the languages used in your project at a glance.

- Scriptable
  - Integrate DirScribe into CI/CD pipelines or other automated workflows to maintain updated structure maps.

- Open Source & Community-Driven
  - MIT-licensed, easily extended, and continuously improved by the community.

## Installation

You can install DirScribe by cloning the repository and running:

```bash
pip install .
```

If you're actively editing the source, you might prefer:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

This sets up DirScribe in "editable" mode so changes in the code take immediate effect.

If DirScribe is published on PyPI in the future, you'll be able to do:

```bash
pip install dirscribe
```

directly.

## Quick Start

Generate a text listing of a directory:

```bash
dirscribe /path/to/project
```

Generate a JSON output and save it to a file:

```bash
dirscribe /path/to/project --output-format json --output-file project_structure.json
```

Include all file contents (no matter the extension):

```bash
dirscribe /path/to/project -e
```

Copy the result to your clipboard (also new in 0.1.2):

```bash
dirscribe /path/to/project --clip
```

That's it! Mix and match the options below for your needs.

## Command-Line Usage

Once installed, you can run dirscribe:

```
dirscribe [DIRECTORY] [OPTIONS]
```

### Common Options

- `-e, --extensions <EXT ...>`
  - Specify which file extensions to include content for (e.g., `-e .py .js`).
  - If you pass `-e` with no extensions, DirScribe will include the contents of all files.
  - If you omit `-e` entirely, it includes no file contents.

- `--detect-language`
  - Enables language detection based on file extensions (e.g., .py -> Python).

- `--skip-hidden`
  - Skips files and directories whose names begin with `.`.

- `--max-size <BYTES>`
  - Maximum file size (in bytes) to read. Files larger than this are ignored.

- `--show-metadata`
  - Displays file metadata (size in bytes, last modification time) next to file content.

- `--output-format <text|json>`
  - Output either a text-based tree or JSON structure. Defaults to text.

- `--output-file <FILE>`
  - Write the output to the specified file instead of printing to stdout.

- `--clip`
  - Copy the final output to your clipboard (requires pyperclip).

### Example: Combine Multiple Options

```bash
dirscribe /path/to/src \
  -e .py .html \
  --detect-language \
  --skip-hidden \
  --max-size 2000 \
  --show-metadata \
  --output-format text \
  --output-file output.txt
```

What this does:
1. Recursively scans `/path/to/src`
2. Shows contents of files with .py or .html extension (up to 2000 bytes)
3. Skips hidden items (names starting with a dot)
4. Displays file size & last modified time
5. Identifies language names where possible
6. Renders as a textual tree
7. Saves it to output.txt (instead of printing to the terminal)

## Python Library Usage

DirScribe can also be used as a library:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from dirscribe.core import export_directory_structure

def main():
    directory = Path("/path/to/src")
    
    # Export directory structure as text (list of lines)
    lines = export_directory_structure(
        target_dir=directory,
        include_extensions=[".py", ".html"],
        skip_hidden=True,
        max_size=2000,
        show_metadata=True,
        detect_language=True,
        output_format="text",
        output_file=None
    )
    
    # If output_format="text" and output_file=None, you get a list of lines
    for line in lines:
        print(line)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Parameters

- `target_dir` (Path)
  - The folder you want to scan.

- `include_extensions` (List[str], optional)
  - File extensions for which file contents should be included.
  - Pass None or use `-e` with no args to include all files.

- `skip_hidden` (bool, default=False)
  - Skip hidden files and directories.

- `max_size` (int, optional)
  - Skip content for files larger than this size.

- `show_metadata` (bool, default=False)
  - Show file size and last modification time.

- `detect_language` (bool, default=False)
  - Attach a language field based on file extension (e.g., .py -> Python).

- `output_format` (str, default="text")
  - Either "text" or "json".

- `output_file` (Path, optional)
  - If provided, the data is written to that file. Returns empty list/string.

### Return Values:

- If `output_format="text"` and `output_file=None`, returns a list of text lines.
- If `output_format="json"` and `output_file=None`, returns a JSON string.
- If `output_file` is set, writes to that file and returns an empty list or empty string.

## Use Cases

### Instant Project Documentation
Generate a tree-like structure of your source code, optionally with file contents.
Great for sharing with collaborators or creating "at-a-glance" docs.

### Code Review & Auditing
Quickly see which files exist, their languages, and read short/medium files directly.

### Security / Compliance Checks
Skip hidden or large files, or selectively scan certain file types.

### CI/CD Integration
Save a JSON manifest of your repository structure as part of your build artifacts.
Compare structure between builds or track changes over time.

### Scripting / Automation
Leverage DirScribe's JSON or text output in custom pipelines or scripts.

## AI Tools Integration

DirScribe's output is perfect for feeding into ChatGPT or other AI tools to analyze or summarize a project's structure:

1. Generate a text or JSON snapshot:
```bash
dirscribe /path/to/src --output-format text > structure.txt
```

2. Copy/paste structure.txt into ChatGPT (or your AI tool).

3. Ask questions like:
   - "Give me an overview of this project."
   - "Identify potential security concerns."
   - "Suggest improvements or refactoring ideas."

By providing AI with a precise structure (and optionally file contents), you can quickly gain insights or documentation without manual exploration.
