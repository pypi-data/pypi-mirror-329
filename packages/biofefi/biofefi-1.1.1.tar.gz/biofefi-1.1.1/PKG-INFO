## Overview

BioFEFI is an open-source, extensible tool for reproducible Machine Learning Modelling and results interpretation. It was originally designed for QSAR/QSPR modelling in biomaterials discovery, but can be applied to any tabular data classification or regression tasks. Version 1.0.0 contains tools for data visualisation and basic pre-processing, it has a collection of machine learning models and interpretation approaches, including fuzzy fusion. The theoretical work underpinning the development of the tool can be found in:

## Install and run BioFEFI

You will need to install **Python 3.11** or **3.12** to use BioFEFI. Make sure you also install `pip` (The Python package installer). If you don't already have it installed, [get Python.](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

You may need to make sure you have OpenMP installed on your machine before you can install BioFEFI. In the terminal use the following commands for your OS:

On Mac:
```shell
brew install libomp
```

You may need to try `brew3` if `brew` does not work. Make sure you [install Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) on your Mac to use the `brew`/`brew3` command.

On Linux (Ubuntu)
```shell
sudo apt install libomp-dev
```

On Windows, this doesn't seem to be a problem. You should be able to proceed with installation.

For information on how to install and run BioFEFI, check the [instructions](https://biomaterials-for-medical-devices-ai.github.io/BioFEFI/users/installation.html).

## Usage

BioFEFI will open in your internet browser when you run it. The main screen will appear giving a brief introduction to the app. To the left of the screen you will see a list of pages with the different functionalities of the app. Explanations can be found in the [instructions](https://biomaterials-for-medical-devices-ai.github.io/BioFEFI/index.html).
