    Args:
        S: The source graph to embed.
        T: The target graph in which to embed. If
            raster_embedding is not None, the graph must be of type zephyr,
            pegasus, or chimera and constructed by dwave_networkx.
        tile: A mask applied to the target graph ``T`` defining a restricted
            space in which to search for embeddings; the tile family
            should match that of ``T``. If the tile is not

            of ``T``, with ``m=sublattice_size``.
            If ``tile==S``, ``embedder`` can be ignored since a 1:1 mapping is
            necessary on each subgraph and easily verified by checking the
            mask is complete.
        sublattice_size: Parameterizes the tile when it is not provided
           as an input argument: defines the number of rows and columns
           of a square sublattice (parameter m of the dwave_networkx graph
           family matching T). ``lattice_size_lower_bound()``
           provides a lower bound based on a fast feasibility filter.
        max_num_emb: Maximum number of embeddings to find.
            Defaults to inf (unbounded).
        use_filter: Specifies whether to check feasibility of arguments for
            embedding independently of the embedder routine. Defaults to False.
        embedder: Specifies the embedding search method, a callable taking ``S``, ``T`` as
            the first two arguments. Defaults to minorminer.subgraph.find_subgraph.
        embedder_kwargs: Dictionary specifying arguments for the embedder
            other than ``S``, ``T``.
        one_to_iterable: Specifies whether the embedder returns a dict with
            iterable values. Defaults to False to match find_subgraph.
        shuffle_all_graphs: If True, the tile-masked target graph and source graph are

            randomization this should be preferred by use of embedder_kwargs. If an
            embedder is a function of the node or edge order this allows

        shuffle_sublattice_order: If True the ordering of sublattices (displacement
            of the tile (mask) on the target graph is randomized. This can allow
            for diversification of the embeddings found.
