# SciGNumpy

SciGNumpy is a lightweight numerical computation library inspired by NumPy. It provides core functionality for handling arrays, matrices, and mathematical computations.

## Features

- Multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.
- Element-wise operations, broadcasting, and scalar operations.
- Linear algebra operations (e.g., dot product, transpose, determinant, inverse).
- Mathematical functions (e.g., sine, cosine, exponential, logarithm).
- Statistical functions (e.g., sum, mean, min, max).

## Installation

Install SciGNumpy using pip:

```bash
pip install scignumpy
```
