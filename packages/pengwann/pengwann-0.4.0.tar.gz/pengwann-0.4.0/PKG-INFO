(technically pronounced *peng-van*, but some pronounce `numpy` as *num-pee* rather than *num-pie*, so who really knows?)

`pengwann` is a lightweight Python package for computing descriptors of chemical bonding and local electronic structure from Wannier functions (as output by [Wannier90](https://wannier.org/)).
Alternatively phrased: `pengwann` replicates the core functionality of [LOBSTER](http://www.cohp.de/), except that the local basis used to represent the Hamiltonian and the density matrix is comprised of Wannier functions rather than pre-defined atomic or pseudo-atomic orbitals. 
The primary advantage of this methodology is that (for energetically isolated bands) **the spilling factor is strictly 0**.

The core features of `pengwann` include:

- Identification of interatomic and on-site interactions in terms of the Wannier functions associated with each atom
- Parsing of Wannier90 output files
- Parallelised computation of the following descriptors:
  - The Wannier orbital Hamilton population (WOHP)
  - The Wannier orbital bond index (WOBI)
  - The Wannier-projected density of states (pDOS)
  - Orbital and k-resolved implementations of all of the above
- Integration of descriptors to derive:
  - LÃ¶wdin-style populations and charges
  - Measures of bond strength and bond order

For further details regarding functionality and methodology, please see the [documentation](https://pengwann.readthedocs.io/).
If something is still unclear after having browsed the docs, then feel free to open a [discussion](https://github.com/PatrickJTaylor/pengWann/discussions) and we will endeavour to get back to you as soon as possible.
