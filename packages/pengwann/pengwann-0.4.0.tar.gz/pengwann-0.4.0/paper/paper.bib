    abstract = {We formulate Wannier orbital overlap population and Wannier orbital Hamilton population to describe the contribution of different orbitals to electron distribution and their interactions. These methods, which are analogous to the well-known crystal orbital overlap population and crystal orbital Hamilton population, provide insight into the distribution of electrons at various atom centers and their contributions to bonding. We apply this formalism in the context of a plane-wave density functional theory calculation. This method provides a means to connect the non-local plane-wave basis to a localized basis by projecting the wave functions from a plane-wave density functional theory calculation to a localized Wannier orbital basis. The main advantage of this formulation is that the spilling factor is strictly zero for insulators and can systematically be made small for metals. We use our proposed method to study and obtain bonding and electron localization insights in five different materials.},

journal = {Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter},
abstract = {Wannier90 is an open-source computer program for calculating maximally-localised Wannier functions (MLWFs) from a set of Bloch states. It is interfaced to many widely used electronic-structure codes thanks to its independence from the basis sets representing these Bloch states. In the past few years the development of Wannier90 has transitioned to a community-driven model; this has resulted in a number of new developments that have been recently released in Wannier90 v3.0. In this article we describe these new functionalities, that include the implementation of new features for wannierisation and disentanglement (symmetry-adapted Wannier functions, selectively-localised Wannier functions, selected columns of the density matrix) and the ability to calculate new properties (shift currents and Berry-curvature dipole, and a new interface to many-body perturbation theory); performance improvements, including parallelisation of the core code; enhancements in functionality (support for spinor-valued Wannier functions, more accurate methods to interpolate quantities in the Brillouin zone); improved usability (improved plotting routines, integration with high-throughput automation frameworks), as well as the implementation of modern software engineering practices (unit testing, continuous integration, and automatic source-code documentation). These new features, capabilities, and code development model aim to further sustain and expand the community uptake and range of applicability, that nowadays spans complex and accurate dielectric, electronic, magnetic, optical, topological and transport properties of materials.}

abstract  ="Metal-aqua ion ([M(H2O)n]X+) formation is a fundamental step in mechanisms that are central to enzymatic and industrial catalysis. Past investigations of such ions have yielded a wealth of information regarding their properties{,} however questions still exist involving the exact structures of these complexes. A prominent example of this is hexaaqua copper(ii) ([Cu(H2O)6]2+){,} with the solution versus gas-phase configurations under debate. The differences are often attributed to the intermolecular interactions between the bulk solvent and the aquated complex{,} resulting in structures stabilized by extended hydrogen-bonding networks. Yet solution phase systems are difficult to study due to the lack of atomic-level positional details. Crystalline solids are ideal models for comparative study{,} as they contain fixed structures that can be fully characterized using diffraction techniques. Here{,} crystalline copper sulfate pentahydrate (CuSO4·5H2O){,} which contains two unique copper–water geometries{,} was studied in order to elucidate the origin of these contrasting hydrated metal envrionments. A combination of solid-state density functional theory and low-temperature X-ray diffraction was used to probe the electronic origins of this phenomenon. This was accomplished through implementation of crystal orbital overlap population and crystal orbital Hamiltonian population analyses into a developmental version of the CRYSTAL14 software. These new computational methods help highlight the delicate interplay between electronic structure and metal–water geometries."}

abstract={Aqueous battery systems feature high safety, but they usually suffer from low voltage and low energy density, restricting their applications in large-scale storage.

The decoupled Zn--MnO2 battery exhibits an open-circuit voltage of 2.83{\thinspace}V (in contrast to the typical voltage of 1.5{\thinspace}V in conventional Zn--MnO2 batteries), as well as cyclability with only 2{\%} capacity fading after deep cycling for 200{\thinspace}h. Benefiting from the full utilization of MnO2, the Zn--MnO2 battery is also able to maintain approximately 100{\%} of its capacity at various discharge current densities. We also demonstrate the feasibility of integrating the Zn--MnO2 battery with a wind and photovoltaic hybrid power generating system. This electrolyte-decoupling strategy is shown to be applicable for other high-performance zinc-based aqueous batteries such as Zn--Cu and Zn--Ag batteries.},

In this study, we present a cost-effective plastic thermoelectric semimetal magnesium bismuthide ($\alpha$-Mg3Bi2), exhibiting remarkable thermoelectric performance. Bulk single-crystalline $\alpha$-Mg3Bi2 exhibits considerable plastic deformation at room temperature, allowing for the fabrication of intricate shapes such as the letters ``SUSTECH'' and a flexible chain. Transmission electron microscopy, time-of-flight neutron diffraction, and chemical bonding theoretic analyses elucidate that the plasticity of $\alpha$-Mg3Bi2 stems from the helical dislocation-driven interlayer slip, small-sized Mg atoms induced weak interlayer Mg-Bi bonds, and low modulus of intralayer Mg2Bi22- networks. Moreover, we achieve a power factor value of up to 26.2{\thinspace}{\textmu}W{\thinspace}cm-1 K-2 along the c-axis at room temperature in an n-type $\alpha$-Mg3Bi2 crystal. Our out-of-plane flexible thermoelectric generator exhibit a normalized power density of 8.1 $\mu$W cm-2 K-2 with a temperature difference of 7.3{\thinspace}K.

abstract={The crucial role of electrolyte cations in CO2 electroreduction has received intensive attention. One prevailing theory is that through electrostatic interactions or direct coordination, larger cations such as Cs+ can better stabilize the key intermediate species for CO and multicarbon (C2+) product generation, for example, on silver and copper, respectively. Here we show that smaller, more acidic alkali metal cations greatly enhance CO2-to-methanol conversion kinetics (Li+ > Na+ > K+ > Cs+) on an immobilized molecular cobalt catalyst, unlike the trend observed for CO and C2+. Through electrokinetic analyses and kinetic isotope effect studies along with computational investigations, we show that the hydration shell of a cation serves as a proton donor in the rate-determining protonation step of adsorbed CHO where acidic cations promote the proton-coupled electron transfer. This study reveals the promotional effect of cation solvation environment on CO2 electroreduction beyond the widely acknowledged stabilizing effect of cations.},

We demonstrate how LOBSTER has been improved by taking into account time-reversal symmetry, thereby speeding up the DFT and LOBSTER calculations by a factor of 2. Over the recent years, the functionalities have also been continually expanded, including accurate projected densities of states (DOSs), crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) analysis, atomic and orbital charges, gross populations, and the recently introduced k-dependent COHP.

abstract={Maximally-localised Wannier functions (MLWFs) are routinely used to compute from first-principles advanced materials properties that require very dense Brillouin zone integration and to build accurate tight-binding models for scale-bridging simulations. At the same time, high-throughput (HT) computational materials design is an emergent field that promises to accelerate reliable and cost-effective design and optimisation of new materials with target properties. The use of MLWFs in HT workflows has been hampered by the fact that generating MLWFs automatically and robustly without any user intervention and for arbitrary materials is, in general, very challenging. We address this problem directly by proposing a procedure for automatically generating MLWFs for HT frameworks. Our approach is based on the selected columns of the density matrix method and we present the details of its implementation in an AiiDA workflow. We apply our approach to a dataset of 200 bulk crystalline materials that span a wide structural and chemical space. We assess the quality of our MLWFs in terms of the accuracy of the band-structure interpolation that they provide as compared to the band-structure obtained via full first-principles calculations. Finally, we provide a downloadable virtual machine that can be used to reproduce the results of this paper, including all first-principles and atomistic simulations as well as the computational workflows.},

abstract={Maximally-localized Wannier functions (MLWFs) are broadly used to characterize the electronic structure of materials. Generally, one can construct MLWFs describing isolated bands (e.g. valence bands of insulators) or entangled bands (e.g. valence and conduction bands of insulators, or metals). Obtaining accurate and compact MLWFs often requires chemical intuition and trial and error, a challenging step even for experienced researchers and a roadblock for high-throughput calculations. Here, we present an automated approach, projectability-disentangled Wannier functions (PDWFs), that constructs MLWFs spanning the occupied bands and their complement for the empty states, providing a tight-binding picture of optimized atomic orbitals in crystals. Key to the algorithm is a projectability measure for each Bloch state onto atomic orbitals, determining if that state should be kept identically, discarded, or mixed into the disentanglement. We showcase the accuracy on a test set of 200 materials, and the reliability by constructing 21,737 Wannier Hamiltonians.},

abstract={Array programming provides a powerful, compact and expressive syntax for accessing, manipulating and operating on data in vectors, matrices and higher-dimensional arrays. NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves1 and in the first imaging of a black hole2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},
