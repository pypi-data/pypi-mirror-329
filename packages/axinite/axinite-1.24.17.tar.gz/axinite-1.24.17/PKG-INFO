## Overview
**Axinite** is an engine for calculating celestial motion. 
You can use it to design your own solar systems, predict trajectories of rockets, simulate gravitational interactions and more.

Check out the docs [here](https://jewels86.gitbook.io/axinite/axinite/getting-started).
### What is `axtools`?
`axtools` is a library to help abstract and simplify Axinite. With `axtools`, Developers can deploy Axinite powered applications with ease. 
You can find the docs [here](https://jewels86.gitbook.io/axinite/axtools/quickstart).

## How can I use Axinite?
For developers looking to deploy Axinite-powered applications, check out [the Python package](https://pypi.org/project/axinite/).

For students, engineers, physicists, and anyone else in the field of astrophysics who want to simulate gravitational interactions, you can check out the [command line interface](https://github.com/jewels86/axcli).
## Supporting Axinite
## Giving Feedback
The biggest way you can help Axinite's development is by giving feedback. Reporting bugs, proposing ideas, and raising issues really help make the library better.
### Contributing
Feel free to open up a [pull request](https://github.com/jewels86/Axinite/pulls) or an [issue](https://github.com/jewels86/Axinite/issues) if there are any changes you'd like introduced to Axinite.
Any help will be appreciated!
### Other ways to support
- Giving this repository a star! This really helps me to get Axinite out to other developers.
- Reaching out! I'd love to hear about your thoughts, ideas, and issues.
- Share the project! Help me spread the word to other students and developers.

## Development Todo List
- [ ] Graceful load function exiting
- [ ] Fix weird euler loading error where first positions are always the origin
- [ ] Add context objects for backends with modifiers and actions
