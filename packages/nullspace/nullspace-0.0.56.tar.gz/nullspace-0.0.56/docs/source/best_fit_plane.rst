Best Fit Plane
==============

In this chapter we are talking about the coordination fixed on virtual rigid object relative to
base.

We need:

    * A origin point
    * two axis direction(third one could be derived by cross production operation)

The origin point is the centroid point of all end effectors.

We define the normal vector by finding the best fitting plane. Then we find
