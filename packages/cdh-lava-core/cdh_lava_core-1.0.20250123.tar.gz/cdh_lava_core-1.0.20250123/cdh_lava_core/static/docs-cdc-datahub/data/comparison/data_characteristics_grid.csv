Card,Description,Content,"The American Board of Family Medicine�s (ABFM) PRIME Registry American Family Cohort (AFC) dataset includes outpatient electronic health records (EHR) from primary care practices in 47 states collected annually from 2018 to present. ABFM data contain demographics, diagnoses, procedures, labs, medications, immunizations, and clinical notes.","Each year the American Hospital Association administers a survey of U.S. hospitals to inform on ownership, services such as outpatient and inpatient care, utilization, expenses, and staffing characteristics of hospitals. There are approximately 6,200 hospitals and 400 health care systems surveyed. Also available are supplementary data on patient satisfaction, readmissions, mortality, and quality.","BD Insights data and interactive dashboards include U.S. hospital-based admissions, discharges, and transfers based on data from approximately 260 hospitals in rural and urban areas. Users can access timely laboratory, medication, and outcome data on hospitalized patients, with a specific focus on patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 or influenza tests.","CDC WONDER is an integrated information and communication system for public health, providing access to a wide variety of public health reports and data systems. It offers a web-based interface to epidemiological data sets, including mortality, natality, cancer statistics, vaccine adverse events, and population estimates. The system enables users to query these databases, analyze the data, and generate tables, maps, and charts using a standardized interface.","Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) data include claims, assessments, surveys, enrollment/summary files, and other data for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. The CDC Data Hub coordinates CDC access to CMS Chronic Conditions Data Warehouse (CCW) data through the Virtual Research Data Center (VRDC). Interested CDC programs must participate in the annual CDC-CMS Intra-Agency Agreement (IAA) that is renewed each spring.","HealthVerity data include transaction-level electronic medical records of medical encounters and diagnoses, laboratory testing results, hospital charge master data, pharmacy claims and medical claims for inpatient and outpatient care. There are seven separate tables, with a common data model, that can be linked using a unique HealthVerity patient identifier.","The Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) is a family of healthcare databases developed through a federal-state partnership sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). HCUP includes the largest collection of hospital care data in the United States with all-payer, encounter-level healthcare data from inpatient, emergency department, and hospital-affiliated or freestanding ambulatory surgery settings.","MarketScan� is a suite of healthcare databases that provide one of the largest collections of proprietary, de-identified patient-level data in the United States. The databases integrate medical claims, pharmacy claims, lab results, hospital discharge information, and electronic health records from a variety of sources including employers, health plans, and state-level Medicaid agencies. Coverage includes commercial, Medicare supplemental, and Medicaid populations, enabling longitudinal tracking of individuals across sites and types of providers. The data support a wide range of healthcare research including drug safety studies, health economics outcomes research, comparative effectiveness research, and epidemiological studies. With records dating back to 1995, MarketScan� provides researchers with significant historical depth for trend analysis and long-term outcome studies.","The National Emergency Medical Services Information System (NEMSIS) is the national database of standardized EMS data from U.S. states and territories. It includes all patient care information resulting from emergency 9-1-1 calls. NEMSIS is a collaborative system to improve patient care through the standardization, aggregation, and use of point-of-care EMS data at local, state, and national levels. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) provides NEMSIS data at no cost to CDC.","The National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) Synthetic Data is an artificial dataset that mirrors the structure and statistical properties of real NNDSS data without containing actual patient information. This dataset is designed for testing, training, and development purposes, allowing researchers and public health professionals to work with data that represents notifiable disease reporting patterns while protecting patient privacy.",IQVIA SMART is a web-based syndicated data analysis and extraction tool that offers access to a variety of IQVIA pharmacy transactions data sets. The IQVIA SMART data provide insights on pharmacy prescription drug dispensing.,"IQVIA HDE Pharmetrics is a comprehensive claims database containing adjudicated medical and pharmaceutical claims for more than 150 million unique enrollees across the United States. The database includes inpatient and outpatient diagnoses and procedures, retail and mail order prescription records, and detailed information about benefit plan enrollment and healthcare provider details. It provides longitudinal patient data suitable for outcomes research, treatment patterns, and healthcare resource utilization studies.","IQVIA� Analytic Research Accelerator (ARA) is a software-as-a-service (SaaS)-based platform containing electronic medical records (EMRs) and claims. Users can manage major real-world evidence (RWE) datasets in one place. IQVIA ARA allows the use of consistent terminologies across countries by using the Observational Medical Outcomes Project (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM), manages and interrogates data in a standard SaaS-based software solution, and performs various analytics.","The National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet�) is a large research �network-of-networks� that coordinates to pool data from health systems throughout the United States using a Common Data Model. Through a cooperative agreement, CDC staff can work with the COVID-19 response team and PCORnet Coordinating Center to develop and refine descriptive or analytic queries for distribution to PCORnet� sites.","Premier / PINC AI� Healthcare is an all-payer, administrative database containing healthcare encounter information from inpatient and hospital-based outpatient encounters. It provides de-identified patient data that support COVID-19-related and other research needs.","PointClickCare (PCC) data include longitudinal electronic health records (EHR) for residents at long-term care facilities (e.g., skilled nursing facilities, assisted senior living facilities, home health care / independent living facilities, acute care facilities and continuum care retirement communities). The data provide detailed health information at the resident and visit level, including vaccine, medication, and laboratory information and demographics such as age, sex, and race and ethnicity.",Quest data are commercial clinical laboratory test data from the United States. These data may be used to examine trends in healthcare laboratory testing and follow the patient�s longitudinal testing record over time.,"RED BOOK is a comprehensive database of drug and healthcare products, providing detailed information about prescription and over-the-counter medications, medical supplies, and devices. It includes pricing information, product descriptions, packaging details, and drug classification data.
