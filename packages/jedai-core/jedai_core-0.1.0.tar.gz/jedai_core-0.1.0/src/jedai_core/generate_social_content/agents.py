            - `revised_content`: The text content finalized by the ReviewComplianceAgent.

            2. **Engagement Optimization Process:**
            - Analyze the `revised_content` and identify relevant keywords or phrases that align with the topic.
            - Use the `search_tool` to fetch popular hashtags and trends related to these keywords.
            - Create a list of hashtags that are:
                - Relevant to the content.
                - Popular in the target audience's industry or interests.
            - Integrate the hashtags directly into the `revised_content` at the end, following a line break.
            - Optionally, include mentions or tags to increase visibility.

            3. **Output Requirements:**
            - Return the optimized text with hashtags appended at the end.
            - Include a separate list of hashtags as part of the output for future analysis.

            4. **Internal Validation:**
            - Ensure the hashtags are appropriate, non-offensive, and aligned with the brand's identity.
            - Validate the text flow and ensure the hashtags do not disrupt the content's readability.

            5. **Output Format:**
            The final output must be a **JSON** object:
            {{
                "final_content": "Final text with hashtags included",
                "hashtags": ["#ExampleTag1", "#ExampleTag2"]
            }}
