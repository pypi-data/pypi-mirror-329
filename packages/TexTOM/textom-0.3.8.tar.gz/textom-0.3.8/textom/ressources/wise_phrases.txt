TexTOM is about having fun!
A good night's sleep dramatically increases a synchrotron user's patience
Not every beamtime makes you happy
Sometimes one has to accept losses
We deeply regret if the results do not align with your expectations
If your signal to noise ratio is high, consider rebinning your data to lower spatial or angular resolution
The perfect textom sample is a free floating pig on a balloon
