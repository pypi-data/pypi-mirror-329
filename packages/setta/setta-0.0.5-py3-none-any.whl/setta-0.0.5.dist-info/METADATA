## What does Setta do?

Setta is a developer tool that streamlines Python coding, configuration, UI creation, and onboarding.

It enables you to:
- Skip the boilerplate parsers and frontend. 
- Effortlessly expose your Python functions as a flexible UI. 
- Configure, interact, and share with ease.

Here's a short intro video:

```

Then go to your project folder and enter:
