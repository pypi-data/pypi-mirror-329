# KNXDclient

A pure Python async client for KNXD's (EIBD's) native Layer 4 KNX protocol.

EIBD is a *NIX daemon for routing EIB/KNX telegrams through various interfaces and programmatically accessing the EIB/KNX bus.
It's part of the no-longer maintained [BCUSDK](https://www.auto.tuwien.ac.at/~mkoegler/index.php/bcusdk).
However, there's a fork called [KNXD](https://github.com/knxd/knxd), which is still actively maintained. 

This package reimplements small parts of the EIBD client (see [BCUSDK documentation](https://web.archive.org/web/20160418110523/https://www.auto.tuwien.ac.at/~mkoegler/eib/sdkdoc-0.0.5.pdf), section 7.7)
in pure Python 3, based on asynchronous coroutines (asyncio).
Currently, it allows to open a Group Socket for sending and receiving KNX telegrams to/for any group address via KNXD.
Additionally, this package includes helper methods `encode_value()` and `decode_value()` to convert the send/received data from/to native Python types according to a known KNX Datapoint Type (DPT).


## Usage example

```python
import asyncio
import knxdclient


def handler(packet: knxdclient.ReceivedGroupAPDU) -> None:
    print("Received group telegram: {}".format(packet))

async def main() -> None:
    # Raises a TimeoutError after 30 seconds of not receiving any traffic. This argument is optional
    connection = knxdclient.KNXDConnection(timeout=30.0) 
    connection.set_group_apdu_handler(handler)
    await connection.connect()
    # Connection was successful. Start receive loop:
    run_task = asyncio.create_task(connection.run())
    # Now that the receive loop is running, we can open the KNXd Group Socket:
    await connection.open_group_socket()

    # Startup completed. Now our `handler()` will receive incoming telegrams and we can send some:
    await connection.group_write(knxdclient.GroupAddress(1,3,2),
                                 knxdclient.KNXDAPDUType.WRITE,
                                 knxdclient.encode_value(True, knxdclient.KNXDPT.BOOLEAN))
    
    await asyncio.sleep(5)
    # Let's stop the connection and wait for graceful termination of the receive loop:
    await connection.stop()
    await run_task


asyncio.run(main())
```

Alternatively, an async iterator can be used for receiving group telegrams:

```python
import asyncio
import knxdclient

# KNX Datapoint Types of some known group addresses, used for decoding incoming values and encoding group RESPONSE
DPTs = {
    knxdclient.GroupAddress(1, 2, 3): knxdclient.KNXDPT.BOOLEAN,
    knxdclient.GroupAddress(4, 5, 6): knxdclient.KNXDPT.FLOAT16,
}

# Some values for responding to group READ telegrams
CURRENT_VALUE = {
    knxdclient.GroupAddress(1, 2, 3): True
}


async def main() -> None:
    connection = knxdclient.KNXDConnection()
    await connection.connect()
    try:
        # Start run task and open group socket
        run_task = asyncio.create_task(connection.run())
        await connection.open_group_socket()

        # Iterate asynchronously over incoming group telegrams
        packet: knxdclient.ReceivedGroupAPDU
        async for packet in connection.iterate_group_telegrams():
            # Respond to GROUP READ telegrams with known values from CURRENT_VALUE dict
            if packet.payload.type == knxdclient.KNXDAPDUType.READ:
                address = packet.dst
                if address in CURRENT_VALUE:
                    await connection.group_write(address,
                                                 knxdclient.KNXDAPDUType.RESPONSE,
                                                 knxdclient.encode_value(CURRENT_VALUE[address], DPTs[address]))
            # Decode and log incoming group WRITE and RESPONSE telegrams 
            else:
                if packet.dst not in DPTs:
                    # Skip telegrams with unknown datatype
                    continue
                value = knxdclient.decode_value(packet.payload.value, DPTs[packet.dst])
                print(f"Telegram from {packet.src} to GAD {packet.dst}: {value}")

    finally:
        # Let's stop the connection and wait for graceful termination of the receive loop:
        await connection.stop()
        await run_task


asyncio.run(main())
```
