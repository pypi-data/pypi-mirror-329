## PTAXFR - DNS Zone Transfer Testing Tool

ptaxfr is a tool that tests domains for DNS zone transfer. <br />
This tool utilizes threading for fast parallel domain testing.

## Installation

```
pip install ptaxfr
```

## Adding to PATH
If you're unable to invoke the script from your terminal, it's likely because it's not included in your PATH. You can resolve this issue by executing the following commands, depending on the shell you're using:

For Bash Users
```bash
echo "export PATH=\"`python3 -m site --user-base`/bin:\$PATH\"" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

For ZSH Users
```bash
echo "export PATH=\"`python3 -m site --user-base`/bin:\$PATH\"" >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

## Usage examples
```
ptaxfr -d example.com
ptaxfr -d example.com -pr
ptaxfr -d example.com -ps
ptaxfr -f domain_list.txt -V
ptaxfr -f domain_list.txt -V -s -t 1000
```
