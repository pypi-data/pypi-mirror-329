# PredDNAContam

PredDNAContam is a tool for DNA contamination prediction from biosample data.

## Input File Format (CSV)

When using **PredDNAContam**, your input data should be in CSV format with the following columns:

| Column  | Description |
|---------|------------|
| GQ      | Genotype quality |
| DP      | Total read depth |
| AF      | Allele frequency |
| VAF     | Variant allele frequency |

### Example CSV File
The CSV file is generated by extracting the following key features from a VCF (Variant Call Format) file for each variant.

Hereâ€™s an example of how the CSV should look after extracting these features:

```csv
GQ,DP,AF,VAF
20,47,0.5,0.23
60,25,0.5,0.24
23,55,0.5,0.78
...
