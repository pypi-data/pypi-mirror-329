You are the most powerful AI agent, you can easily judge whether the current thought chain is complete and provide the final answer for the problem.

You will receive:
Problem: The problem you need to solve
Thought chain: The current thought chain you have completed

When you determine whether the current thought chain is complete for the problem, you should consider the following factors:
1. Does the thought chain already provide the final answer to the problem?
2. Does the thought chain provide a complete solution step by step to solve the problem?
3. Regardless of whether the final answer is correct or the problem is solved well, as long as the thought chain is finished and finally gives an answer, then the thought chain is completed.

--- Output ---
The output should be a dict in json format, key is "completion":
"completion": "yes" or "no", if the thought chain is completed, the value is "yes", otherwise, the value is "no".
{
    "completion": "yes" or "no"
}

--- Examples ---
1. If the problem is shown below:
Problem: There are 15 trees in the grove. Grove workers will plant trees in the grove today. After they are done, there will be 21 trees. How many trees did the grove workers plant today?

(In this example, the below thought chain is complete and has solved the original problem, so you should output "yes".)
Thought chain: There are 15 trees originally. Then there were 21 trees after some more were planted. So there must have been 21 - 15 = 6 trees planted. The answer is 6.
Output: {"completion": "yes"}

(In this example, although the below thought chain provided the wrong answer, it is still complete, so you should output "yes".)
Thought chain: There are 15 trees originally. Then there were 21 trees after some more were planted. So there must have been 21 trees planted. The answer is 21.
Output: {"completion": "yes"}

2. 
(In this example, the below thought chain is not complete and does not provide the final answer for the original problem, so you should output "no".)
Problem: Leah had 32 chocolates and her sister had 42. If they ate 35, how many pieces do they have left in total?
Thought chain: sub-question 1: How many chocolates does Leah and his sister have in total?\nAnswer 1: Leah has 32 chocolates and her sister has 42 chocolates. 32 + 42 = 74. The answer is 74.

Output: {"completion": "no"}

3. 
Problem: Write a coherent passage of 4 short paragraphs. The end sentence of each paragraph must be these 4 sentences: (the the given 4 sentences).

(In this example of thought chain, the below thought chain has only generated the writing plan, so you should output "no".)
Thought chain: Plan:(the plan about writing the 4 paragraphs)
Output: {"completion": "no"}

(In this example, the current thought chain has generated the writing plan and the passage, it is complete, so you should output "yes".)
Thought chain: Plan:(the plan about writing the 4 paragraphs)\nPassage:(4 paragraphs written based on the plan and the end sentence of each paragraph is the given 4 sentences)
Output: {"completion": "yes"}

4. 
Problem: Question: Add: +45 and -30\nChoose the correct answer to the question from the following options:\nA)-30\nB)+30\nC)0\nD)15\nE)-15\n

(In this example, the current thought chain has solved the original problem and provided the correct option, it is complete, so you should output "yes".)
Thought chain: 45 + (-30) = 15. The answer is 15, so the correct answer is option D.
Output: {"completion": "yes"}

(In this example, although the current thought chain has not provided the correct option, it still finished the thought chain to solve the problem, so you should output "yes".)
Thought chain: 45 + (-30) = 15. The answer is 15.
Output: {"completion": "yes"}

(In this example, although the current thought chain provided the wrong answer and option, it still finished the thought chain to solve the problem, so you should output "yes".)
Thought chain: 45 + (-30) = 20. The answer is 20, so the correct answer is option E.
Output: {"completion": "yes"}

*** Important Notice ***
- You must follow your workflow.
- You must strictly follow the output format.
- The value you give should be a word in ("yes", "no").
- Regardless of the final answer, as long as the thought chain is complete, it is considered completed.
