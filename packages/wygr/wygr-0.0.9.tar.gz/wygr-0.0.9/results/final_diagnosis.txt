### Final Diagnosis:

- **Panic Disorder/Anxiety-Related Episodes:**
  - The symptoms of intense chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness, sweating, and a feeling of impending doom are consistent with panic attacks. Both the cardiologist and psychologist reports highlight the possibility of panic disorder, especially given the patient's history of anxiety and normal cardiac evaluations.

- **Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD):**
  - GERD is mentioned by both the cardiologist and pulmonologist as a potential cause of the patient's symptoms, including chest pain and shortness of breath. Despite being on PPIs, lifestyle factors or suboptimal management could still trigger symptoms that mimic cardiac or respiratory issues.

- **Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVCs):**
  - The cardiologist notes occasional PVCs, which, while generally benign, can contribute to the sensation of palpitations and may be exacerbated by stress or anxiety. This aligns with the patient's symptoms and could be a contributing factor to his discomfort.
