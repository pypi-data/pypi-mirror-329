class Application(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    """
    The main service container for the Orionis Framework, ensuring persistent dependency resolution.

    This class acts as a singleton service container, similar to Laravel's Application class.
    It maintains service bindings, ensures proper initialization, and prevents unnecessary re-instantiation.

    Attributes
    ----------
    container : Container
        The IoC container that holds all service bindings.
    booted : bool
        Indicates whether the application has been initialized.
    error_info : tuple or None
        Stores error information if an exception occurs during boot.

    Methods
    -------
    boot()
        Initializes the application and registers all necessary dependencies.
    isBooted()
        Checks if the application is currently running.
    getError()
        Retrieves stored error information, if any.

        Boots the application and registers necessary dependencies.

        This method ensures that all required services are bound to the container and instantiated.

        Returns
        -------
        Application
            The current instance of the application.

        Raises
        ------
        Exception
