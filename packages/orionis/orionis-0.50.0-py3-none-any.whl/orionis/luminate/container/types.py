class Types(ITypes):
    """
    A class that handles validation of primitive types to prevent registering services with primitive-type names.

    This class provides a method to check if a given name corresponds to a primitive type.
    It is used to ensure that services or aliases are not registered with names that conflict
    with Python's built-in primitive types.

    Attributes
    ----------
    _primitive_types : set
        A set containing Python's built-in primitive types and their string representations.

    Methods
    -------
    isPrimitive(name: str) -> bool
        Checks if the provided name corresponds to a primitive type.

        Checks if the provided name corresponds to a primitive type.

        This method is used to prevent registering services or aliases with names that

        Parameters
        ----------
        name : str
            The name of the service or alias to check.

        Returns
        -------
        bool
            True if the name corresponds to a primitive type, False otherwise.

        Raises
        ------
        OrionisContainerException
            If the name matches a primitive type (not implemented in this method).
