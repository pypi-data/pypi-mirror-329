class Application(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    """
    The main service container for the Orionis Framework, ensuring persistent dependency resolution.

    This class acts as a singleton service container, similar to Laravel's Application class.
    It maintains service bindings, ensures proper initialization, and prevents unnecessary re-instantiation.

    Attributes
    ----------
    container : Container
        The IoC container that holds all service bindings.
    booted : bool
        Indicates whether the application has been initialized.
    error_info : tuple or None
        Stores error information if an exception occurs during boot.

    Methods
    -------
    boot()
        Initializes the application and registers all necessary dependencies.
    isBooted()
        Checks if the application is currently running.
    getError()
        Retrieves stored error information, if any.
