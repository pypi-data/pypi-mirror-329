    Context manager for resolving dependencies within a valid Orionis application context.

    This function ensures that Orionis is properly initialized before resolving dependencies,
    similar to how Laravelâ€™s `app()` helper works.

    Yields
    ------
    Application
        The initialized Orionis application instance.

    Raises
    ------
    RuntimeError
        If the application has not been properly initialized.
