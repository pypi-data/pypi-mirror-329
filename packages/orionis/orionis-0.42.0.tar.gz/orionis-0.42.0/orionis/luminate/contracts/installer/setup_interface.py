    Abstract base class for setup operations.

    This interface defines a contract for setup classes, requiring the implementation
    of the `handle` method to execute setup logic.

    Methods
    -------
    handle()
        Abstract method that must be implemented by subclasses to define setup behavior.

        Execute the setup process.

        This method must be implemented by any subclass to perform the necessary
        setup actions. The specific implementation details depend on the subclass.

        Raises
        ------
        NotImplementedError
            If the method is not implemented in a subclass.
