## Motivation

When writing an `SConstruct.py` configuration it is difficult to:

- Specify libraries and warnings for each build since the default environment is global
- Declare executable targets that depend on builds and don't need to be built themselves
- Parse outputs from `conan` to get include paths for build dependencies since they don't appear in the exported `conandeps`
- Declare and chain together aliases for external scripts

We can use `miniscons` to keep the `SConstruct.py` file short and get an interface like this:

```yaml
builds:
  build
  tests

targets:
  start -> build
  test -> tests

scripts:
  tidy
  clean

routines:
  lint -> [tidy, clean]

flags:
  --dump
```

## Installing

```bash
pip install miniscons
```

## Documentation

Documentation and more detailed examples are hosted on [Github Pages](https://joellefkowitz.github.io/miniscons).

## Â Usage

Parse the `SConscript_conandeps` if you are using `conan`:

```py
from miniscons import conan

env = conan()
```

Add the builds with their specific warning flags and libs to include:

```py
from miniscons import Build, flags, packages
from walkmate import tree

build = Build(
    "build",
    tree("src", r"(?<!\.spec)\.cpp$"),
    flags("c++11", ["shadow"]),
)

tests = Build(
    "tests",
    tree("src", r"\.cpp$", ["main.cpp"]),
    flags("c++11"),
    packages(["gtest"]),
)
```

Add the executable targets that depend on the builds with their runtime arguments:

```py
from miniscons import Target

start = Target("start", build)

test = Target("test", tests, ["--gtest_brief"])
```

Add the scripts to invoke your tooling:

```py
from miniscons import Script
from walkmate import tree

includes = tests.packages["CPPPATH"]

clean = Script(
    "cppclean",
    ["cppclean", "."],
)

tidy = Script(
    "clang-tidy",
    [
        "clang-tidy",
        tree("src", r"\.(cpp)$"),
        "--",
        [f"-I{i}" for i in includes],
    ],
)
```

Add the routines and flags for your interface:

```py
from miniscons import Flag, Routine

lint = Routine("lint", [clean, tidy])

dump = Flag("--dump")
```

Register all the declarations with the environment and add handlers for each flag:

```py
from miniscons import Tasks
from SCons.Script.Main import GetOption

cli = Tasks(
    [build, tests],
    [start, test],
    [tidy, clean],
    [lint],
    [dump],
)

cli.register(env)

if GetOption("dump"):
    cli.dump()
```

Now if we run

```bash
scons --dump
```

We get our interface:

```yaml
scons: Reading SConscript files ...

builds:
  build
  tests

targets:
  start -> build
  test -> tests

scripts:
  tidy
  clean

routines:
  lint -> [tidy, clean]

flags:
  --dump
```

## Discussion

Why not use a simple task runner for scripts and routines?

Some scripts need access to the include paths that appear in the `SConstruct.py` file so they need to be integrated into the scons workflow.
