## ⚡️ Installation

To install Merlin, you can simply run:

```python
pip install merlin-vlm
```

For an editable installation, use the following commands to clone and install this repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/StanfordMIMI/Merlin.git
cd merlin
pip install -e .
```

## 🚀 Inference with Merlin

To create a Merlin model with both image and text embeddings enabled, use the following:
```python
from merlin import Merlin

model = Merlin()
```

To initialize the model with **only image embeddings** active, use:
```python
from merlin import Merlin

model = Merlin(ImageEmbedding=True)
```

#### For inference on a demo CT scan, please check out the [demo](documentation/demo.py)

#### For additional information, please read the [documentation](documentation/inference.md).
