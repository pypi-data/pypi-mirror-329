## Getting started

### Installation

#### Pip installation

To install this module with pip, please use:

```bash
pip install flight-mech
```

#### Manual installation

For a manual installation, please clone the repository and install the required Python libraries using the command:

```bash

```

### Documentation

The documentation is available online [here](https://flight-mech.creusy.fr).

Otherwise, if you decided to clone the repository, you can generate the documentation using the following commands:

```bash
cd docs
make html
```

And open the file `docs/_build/html/index.html` in your browser. 

### Functionalities

This software includes various modules to build a numerical plane model and compute its characteristics. The modules implemented are the following:

- `atmosphere` : defines several atmosphere models to compute density, temperature, pressure and other quantities.
- `aerodynamics` : contains functions to compute quantities in the boundary layer of a fluid flow.
- `airfoil` : allows to define the geometry of an airfoil and compute the lift and moment coefficients.
- `wing` : allows to define the geometry of a wing and compute the lift and drag coefficients.
- `fuel` : defines several types of broadly used fuels in aeronautics.
- `turbine` : allows to define several types of turbine to compute their thrust and consumption at various operating conditions.
- `plane` : allows to define a numerical plane model, binding the previous modules, to compute its flight characteristics.
