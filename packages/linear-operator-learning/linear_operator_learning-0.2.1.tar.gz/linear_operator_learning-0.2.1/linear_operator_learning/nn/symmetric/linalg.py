def invariant_orthogonal_projector(rep_X: Representation):
    r"""Computes the orthogonal projection to the invariant subspace.

    The input representation :math:`\rho_{\mathcal{X}}: \mathbb{G} \mapsto \mathbb{G}\mathbb{L}(\mathcal{X})` is transformed to the spectral basis given by:

    .. math::
        \rho_\mathcal{X} = \mathbf{Q} \left( \bigoplus_{i\in[1,n]} \hat{\rho}_i \right) \mathbf{Q}^T

    where :math:`\hat{\rho}_i` denotes an instance of one of the irreducible representations of the group, and :math:`\mathbf{Q}: \mathcal{X} \mapsto \mathcal{X}` is the orthogonal change of basis from the spectral basis to the original basis.

    The projection is performed by:
        1. Changing the basis to the representation spectral basis (exposing signals per irrep).
        2. Zeroing out all signals on irreps that are not trivial.
        3. Mapping back to the original basis set.

    Args:
        rep_X (Representation): The representation for which the orthogonal projection to the invariant subspace is computed.

    Returns:
        Tensor: The orthogonal projection matrix to the invariant subspace, :math:`\mathbf{Q} \mathbf{S} \mathbf{Q}^T`.
