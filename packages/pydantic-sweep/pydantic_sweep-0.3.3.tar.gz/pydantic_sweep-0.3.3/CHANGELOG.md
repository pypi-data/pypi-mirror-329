- License documentation and examples under 0BSD

### 0.3.1

- `initialize` accepts nested dictionaries for `default`/`constant` arguments.

### 0.3.0

- `field` now checks that values are hashable by default. This can be disabled by 
  setting `check=False`.

## 0.2

### 0.2.1

  selection from union types in nested models.

### 0.2.0

- `DefaultValue` is checked against conflicting settings the same way as normal values
- Passing `DefaultValue` to the `default`/`constant` argument of `initialize` works as
  expected.
