# robocorp-action-server

> **⚠️ Deprecation Notice:**
> Development of this package has moved and continues under a new PyPI package: [sema4ai-action-server](https://pypi.org/project/sema4ai-action-server/).
> You can follow the development in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Sema4AI/actions).
> The [robocorp-action-server](https://pypi.org/project/robocorp-action-server/) package will no longer receive updates, so please update your dependencies to ensure continued support and improvements.


[Robocorp Action Server](https://github.com/robocorp/robocorp#readme) is a Python framework designed to simplify the deployment of actions (AI or otherwise).

An `action` in this case is defined as a Python function (which has inputs/outputs defined), which is served by the `Robocorp Action Server`.

The `Robocorp Action Server` automatically generates an OpenAPI spec for your Python code, enabling different AI/LLM Agents to understand and call your Action. It also manages the Action lifecycle and provides full traceability of what happened during runs.

## 1. Install Action Server

Action Server is available as a stand-alone fully signed executable and via `pip install robocorp-action-server`.
> We recommend the executable to prevent confusion in case you have multiple/crowded Python environments, etc.

#### For macOS

```sh
# Install Robocorp Action Server
brew update
brew install robocorp/tools/action-server 
```

#### For Windows

```sh
# Download Robocorp Action Server
curl -o action-server.exe https://downloads.robocorp.com/action-server/releases/latest/windows64/action-server.exe

# Add to PATH or move to a folder that is in PATH
setx PATH=%PATH%;%CD%
```

#### For Linux

```sh
# Download Robocorp Action Server
curl -o action-server https://downloads.robocorp.com/action-server/releases/latest/linux64/action-server
chmod a+x action-server

# Add to PATH or move to a folder that is in PATH
sudo mv action-server /usr/local/bin/
```

## 2. Run your first Action

```sh
# Bootstrap a new project using this template.
# You'll be prompted for the name of the project (directory):
action-server new

# Start Action Server 
cd my-project
action-server start --expose
```

👉 You should now have an Action Server running locally at: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080), so open that in your browser and the web UI will guide you further.

👉 Using the `--expose` -flag, you also get a public internet-facing URL (something like "https://twently-cuddly-dinosaurs.robocorp.link") and the related token. These are the details that you need to configure your AI Agent to have access to your Action

## What do you need in your Action Package

An `Action Package` is currently defined as a local folder that contains at least one Python file containing an action entry point (a Python function marked with `@action` -decorator from `robocorp.actions`).

The `package.yaml` file is required for specifying the Python environment and dependencies for your Action ([RCC](https://github.com/robocorp/rcc/) will be used to automatically bootstrap it and keep it updated given the `package.yaml` contents).

> Note: the `package.yaml` is optional if the action server is not being used as a standalone (i.e.: if it was pip-installed it can use the same python environment where it's installed).

### Bootstrapping a new Action

Start new projects with:

`action-server new`

Note: the `action-server` executable should be automatically added to your python installation after `pip install robocorp-action-server`, but if for some reason it wasn't pip-installed, it's also possible to use `python -m robocorp.action_server` instead of `action-server`.

After creating the project, it's possible to serve the actions under the current directory with:

`action-server start`

For example: When running `action-server start`, the action server will scan for existing actions under the current directory, and it'll start serving those.

After it's started, it's possible to access the following URLs:

- `/index.html`: UI for the Action Server.
- `/openapi.json`: Provides the openapi spec for the action server.
- `/docs`: Provides access to the APIs available in the server and a UI to test it.
