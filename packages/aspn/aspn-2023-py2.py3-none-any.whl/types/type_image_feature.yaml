description: Image feature characteristics

fields:
- name: response
  type: float64
  description: >
      Value representing the magnitude of the response of the keypoint detection
      algorithm used to locate this keypoint in the image.
- name: orientation
  units: rad
  type: float64
  description: >
      Value representing the orientation of the detected keypoint, as measured
      relative to the image coordinate system (radians, clockwise). Metadata
      flag determines if this field is calculated by the current keypoint
      detector.
- name: size
  units: pixels
  type: float64
  description: >
      Effective size (pixels) of the detected keypoint. This field takes into
      consideration the octave and kernel used to localize the keypoint, and
      normalizes to the original size of the image.
- name: class_id
  type: uint16
  description: >
      ID that ties the detected keypoint to a class or group of keypoints.
- name: octave
  type: uint16
  description: >
      Octave or pyramid layer from which the detected keypoint was extracted.
- name: descriptor_size
  type: uint16
  description: >
      Size of the descriptor in bytes.
- name: descriptor
  type: uint8[descriptor_size]
  description: >
      Feature descriptor.
