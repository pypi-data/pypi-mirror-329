  description: >
    Reference time system used to express the data in this message. In a multi-GNSS receiver
    (GPS/GLONASS/Galileo/QZSS/BeiDou) all pseudorange observations must refer to one receiver clock
    only. The receiver clock time of the measurement is the receiver clock time of the received
    signals. It is identical for the phase and range measurements and is identical for all
    satellites observed in a given epoch.
