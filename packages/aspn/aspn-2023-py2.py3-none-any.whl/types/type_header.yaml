fields:
- name: vendor_id
  type: uint32
  description: >
    Unique identifier that identifies the device or application vendor.  Vendor ID is user-selected,
    inspired by your company name to mitigate conflicts with other users.  Vendor IDs 0x23 00 00 00
    through 0x23 FF FF FF inclusive are reserved and shall not be chosen as user-selected vendor
    IDs.
- name: device_id
  type: uint64
  description: >
    Unique identifier that identifies the sensor or device type as assigned by the vendor.
    Device_ids are unique within a given vendor_id.
- name: context_id
  type: uint32
  description: >
    Unique identifier that provides additional context to define a logical stream of data from the
    sensor or device as assigned by the vendor.  This identifier allows multiple measurements of the
    same type to be provided by a device. Context_ids are unique within a given vendor_id and
    device_id.
- name: sequence_id
  type: uint16
  description: >
    Unique identifier for a specific message within a data stream as defined by a vendor_id,
    device_id, and context_id.  Sequential messages from each data source (identified by vendor_id,
    device_id, and context_id) shall increment by exactly 1 and rollover to 0 after an overflow.
