controlled: no
distribution: A
experimental: false
description: |
  ASPN custom type representing a point. This includes optional information
  (indicated by included_terms) for the position and a correspondence ID for the
  point.

fields:
- name: included_terms
  type: uint8
  description: >
    Indicates which information is included about the point
      0 = no information included (unknown point)
      1 = id included (corresponded point)
      2 = position included (known point)
      3 = id and position included

- name: id
  type: uint32
  description: >
    Unique identification number assigned by the sensor. Points that have the
    same id from a sensor are multiple instances of the same point as determined
    by a sensor's point correspondence.

- name: position_reference_frame
  enum:
  - NONE: |
      No reference frame. This is only valid if position is not included
      (included_terms is 0 or 1).
  - GEODETIC: |
      Point position relative to the WGS-84 reference expressed using position1 as geodetic latitude
      in radians, position2 as longitude in radians, and position3 as geodetic altitude (or height
      above the WGS-84 ellipsoid) in meters. Each term is optional.
      position_covariance is given using north-south position error in meters (an expression of
      geodetic latitude error), east-west position error in meters (an expression of longitude
      error), and geodetic altitude error in meters. In the case of nulled position components, the
      corresponding error covariance terms are omitted.
  length: 8
  description: >
    Defines position reference.

- name: position1
  type: float64?
  units: various
  description: >
    First position term as defined in position_reference_frame.
- name: position2
  type: float64?
  units: various
  description: >
    Second position term as defined in position_reference_frame.
- name: position3
  type: float64?
  units: various
  description: >
    Third position term as defined in position_reference_frame.

- name: num_position_components
  type: uint8
  description: >
    Dimension of position provided.
- name: position_covariance
  type: float64[num_position_components, num_position_components]
  units: m^2
  description: >
    Position error covariance (or variance depending on num_position_components) as defined in
    position_reference_frame.
