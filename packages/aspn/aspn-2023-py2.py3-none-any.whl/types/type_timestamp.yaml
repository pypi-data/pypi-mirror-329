description: >
  Whole number nanoseconds elapsed since timestamp's zero epoch.  If negative, whole number
  nanoseconds until timestamp's zero epoch.  The zero epoch definition is based on the timing source
  used by the message provider.  The timing source used by the message provider is defined by the
  `timestamp_clock_id` included in the `type_metadataheader` as part of the metadata.  Additionally,
  the timestamp's digits of precision are included in the `type_metadataheader` as part of the
  metadata, which may be useful if an implementation is converting the timestamp to another type
  internally.

  If needed, the time elapsed in seconds is equal to elapsed_nsec * 1e-9.
