  Integrity provides a numerical measure of the trustworthiness of the associated measurement.  The
  integrity_method enum specifies the integrity method and the appropriate interpretation of the
  integrity_value.

    Enumerated field which describes the meaning of the integrity value.  Integrity methods may use
    multiple enum entries if there is a need to pass multiple integrity values.  For example, an
    integrity method with 3 parameters may use 3 enum entries (e.g., MY_METHOD_VALUE1,
    MY_METHOD_VALUE2, MY_METHOD_VALUE3).  When integrity is reported in a message, a vector of
    integrity types is passed.  In the MY_METHOD example, num_integrity = 3 just for the MY_METHOD
    integrity.  If additional integrity methods are also reported, then num_integrity would be
    greater than 3 to include those additional methods.
