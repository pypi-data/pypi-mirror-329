system_type: standard
category: type
controlled: no
distribution: A
experimental: false
description: >
  Describes the translational and angular offset between the sensor frame and the platform body
  frame.  Platform body frame is defined using axes in forward, right, and down convention, and the
  origin is system defined.  This type also contains the uncertainty associated with the
  translational and angular offset.

fields:
- name: lever_arm
  type: float64[3]
  units: m
  description: >
    3x1 lever arm vector describing the sensor position in the platform body frame.
- name: lever_arm_sigma
  type: float64[3]
  units: m
  description: >
    3x1 lever arm uncertainty vector as standard deviations in the platform body frame.
- name: orientation_quaternion
  type: float64[4]?
  description: >
    Four element quaternion, q = [a, b, c, d], where a = cos(phi/2), b = (phi_x/phi)*sin(phi/2), c =
    (phi_y/phi)*sin(phi/2), and d = (phi_z/phi)*sin(phi/2).  In this description, the vector [phi_x,
    phi_y, phi_z] represents the rotation vector that describes the frame rotation to be applied to
    the "reference" frame (ECI, ECEF, or NED) to rotate it into the axes that describe the measured
    attitude, and the value phi is the magnitude of the [phi_x, phi_y, phi_z] vector.

    Orientation is optional in the sense that orientation shall be specified except in the case that
    orientation is meaningless, for example, in the case of an RF antenna mounting.

    See "conventions" documentation for more detailed information.
- name: orientation_tilt_error_covariance
  type: float64[3, 3]?
  units: rad^2
  description: >
    Tilt error covariance matrix.  This matrix represents the uncertainty in the "tilt errors" that
    represent the additional rotation to be applied to the provided attitude quaternion in order to
    convert it to the true attitude with no errors.  By convention, these "tilt errors" are
    expressed in the reference frame (ECI, ECEF, or NED).

    Tilt error covariance is optional only because orientation itself is optional.  Orientation
    error covariance shall be provided if orientation is provided.

    See "conventions" documentation for more detailed information.
