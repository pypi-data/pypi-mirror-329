fields:
- name: header
  type: type_header
  description: >
    Standard ASPN measurement header.
- name: time_of_validity
  type: type_timestamp
  description: >
    Time at which the measurement is considered to be valid.
- name: reference
  enum:
  - AGL: >
      height above ground level (AGL). Generally, position and terrain elevation data are required
      to convert between AGL and (MSL or HAE).
  - MSL: >
      height above mean sea level (MSL). Generally, position is required to convert between MSL and
      HAE.
  - HAE: height above the WGS-84 ellipsoid (HAE), also known as geodetic altitude.
  length: 8
  description: >
    Specifies altitude reference.
- name: altitude
  type: float64
  units: m
  description: >
    Altitude in meters, with altitude defined by the enum, altitude_type.
- name: variance
  type: float64
  units: m^2
  description: >
    Altitude variance.
- name: error_model
  enum:
  - NONE: No additional error model provided (num_error_model_params = 0).
  - FOGM: |
      First-order Gauss-Markov (FOGM) process, defined by the following parameters
      (num_error_model_params = 3):
        1) standard_deviation, units: m, description: standard deviation of a scalar, first order
        Gauss-Markov measurement noise model.
        2) time_constant, units: seconds, description: time constant of a scalar, first order
        Gauss-Markov measurement noise model.
        3) initial_standard_deviation, units: m, description: initial standard deviation of a
        scalar, first order Gauss-Markov measurement noise model.
  length: 32
  description: >
    Defines an optional error model for other than zero-mean, additive, white
    Gaussian noise (AWGN).
- name: num_error_model_params
  type: uint16
  description: >
    Number of parameters required for the error model chosen.
- name: error_model_params
  type: float64[num_error_model_params]
  units: various
  description: Error model parameters that characterize the optional error model.

- name: num_integrity
  type: uint8
  description: >
    Number of integrity values.

- name: integrity
  type: type_integrity[num_integrity]
  description: >
    Measurement integrity.  Includes the integrity method used and an integrity value (which is to
    be interpreted based upon the integrity method).  The intent of allowing num_integrity > 1 is to
    report multiple integrity values based on multiple integrity methods.
