name: measurement_magnetic_field
version: 2023
system_type: standard
category: measurement
controlled: no
distribution: A
experimental: false
description: >
  Vector magnetic field.  Represents the magnetic field strength along sensor x, y, and z axes as
  defined in mounting.  May represent 1-D, 2-D, or 3-D measurement

fields:
- name: header
  type: type_header
  description: >
    Standard ASPN measurement header.
- name: time_of_validity
  type: type_timestamp
  description: >
    Time at which the measurement is considered to be valid.

- name: num_meas
  type: uint8
  description: >
    Dimension of measurement provided.  May be 1, 2, or 3.

- name: x_field_strength
  type: float64?
  units: nT
  description: >
    Field strength of magnetic field in nanoTesla (nT).

- name: y_field_strength
  type: float64?
  units: nT
  description: >
    Field strength of magnetic field in nanoTesla (nT).

- name: z_field_strength
  type: float64?
  units: nT
  description: >
    Field strength of magnetic field in nanoTesla (nT).

- name: covariance
  type: float64[num_meas, num_meas]
  units: (nT)^2
  description: >
    Measurement error variance or covariance depending on measurement dimension.

- name: error_model
  enum:
  - NONE: No additional error model provided (num_error_model_params = 0).
  length: 32
  description: >
    Defines an optional error model for other than zero-mean, additive, white Gaussian noise (AWGN).
- name: num_error_model_params
  type: uint16
  description: >
    Number of parameters required for the error model chosen.
- name: error_model_params
  type: float64[num_error_model_params]
  units: various
  description: >
    Error model parameters that characterize the optional error model.

- name: num_integrity
  type: uint8
  description: >
    Number of integrity values.

- name: integrity
  type: type_integrity[num_integrity]
  description: >
    Measurement integrity.  Includes the integrity method used and an integrity value (which is to
    be interpreted based upon the integrity method).  The intent of allowing num_integrity > 1 is to
    report multiple integrity values based on multiple integrity methods.
