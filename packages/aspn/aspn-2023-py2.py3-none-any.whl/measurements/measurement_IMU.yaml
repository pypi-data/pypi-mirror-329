  enum:
  - INTEGRATED: >
      delta velocity and delta rotation measurements from the device's three axis accelerometers and
      three axis gyroscopes. Specific force integrated over last measurement period expressed as
      delta_v array in m/s. Angular rate integrated over last measurement period expressed as
      delta_theta array in radians. Time of validity is the end of integration period. Integration
      period is from previous measurement to the current measurement.
  - SAMPLED: >
      sampled specific force and rotation rates from the device's three axis accelerometers and
      three axis gyroscopes. Specific force is sampled expressed as an array in m/s/s. Angular rate
      is sampled and expressed as an array in rad/s.

    Number of integrity values.

- name: integrity
  type: type_integrity[num_integrity]
  description: >
    Measurement integrity.  Includes the integrity method used and an integrity value (which is to
    be interpreted based upon the integrity method).  The intent of allowing num_integrity > 1 is to
    report multiple integrity values based on multiple integrity methods.
