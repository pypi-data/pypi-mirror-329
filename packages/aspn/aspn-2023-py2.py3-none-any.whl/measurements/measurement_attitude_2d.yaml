description: >
  Two-dimensional, local level, geographic attitude expressed in the locally level NED frame as a
  rotation about two axes as defined by the reference_frame.

- name: reference_frame
  enum:
  - NE: Local level, geographic attitude expressed in the locally level NED
      frame as a rotation about the E-axis followed by rotation about the N-axis. Positive rotation
      follows the right-hand rule.  The third rotation in the NED-frame is unspecified and is not
      sensed.  Use attitude_3d to report a sensed third dimension that is zero.  See also NED
      coordinate frame definition for N, E, and D definitions.
  - ND: Local level, geographic attitude expressed in the locally level NED
      frame as a rotation about the D-axis followed by rotation about the N-axis. Positive rotation
      follows the right-hand rule.  The third rotation in the NED-frame is unspecified and is not
      sensed.  Use attitude_3d to report a sensed third dimension that is zero.  See also NED
      coordinate frame definition for N, E, and D definitions.
  - ED: Local level, geographic attitude expressed in the locally level NED
      frame as a rotation about the D-axis followed by rotation about the E-axis. Positive rotation
      follows the right-hand rule.  The third rotation in the NED-frame is unspecified and is not
      sensed.  Use attitude_3d to report a sensed third dimension that is zero.  See also NED

- name: num_integrity
  type: uint8
  description: >
    Number of integrity values.

- name: integrity
  type: type_integrity[num_integrity]
  description: >
    Measurement integrity.  Includes the integrity method used and an integrity value (which is to
    be interpreted based upon the integrity method).  The intent of allowing num_integrity > 1 is to
    report multiple integrity values based on multiple integrity methods.
