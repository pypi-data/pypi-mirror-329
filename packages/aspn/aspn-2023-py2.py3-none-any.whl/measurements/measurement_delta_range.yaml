name: measurement_delta_range
version: 2023
system_type: standard
category: measurement
controlled: no
distribution: A
experimental: false
description: >
  Delta range is the distance between the sensor position at time_of_validity and the sensor
  position at time_of_validity - delta_t.

fields:
- name: header
  type: type_header
  description: >
    Standard ASPN measurement header.
- name: time_of_validity
  type: type_timestamp
  description: >
    Time at which the measurement is considered to be valid.

- name: delta_t
  type: float64
  units: sec
  description: >
    Duration of the observation time interval. The time_of_validity denotes the end of the time
    interval. The start of the time interval is time_of_validity - delta_t.
- name: obs
  type: float64
  units: m
  description: >
    Delta range over time period.
- name: variance
  type: float64
  units: m^2
  description: >
    Measurement error variance.

- name: error_model
  enum:
  - NONE: No additional error model provided (num_error_model_params = 0).
  length: 32
  description: >
    Defines an optional error model for other than zero-mean, additive, white
    Gaussian noise (AWGN).
- name: num_error_model_params
  type: uint16
  description: >
    Number of parameters required for the error model chosen.
- name: error_model_params
  type: float64[num_error_model_params]
  units: various
  description: >
    Error model parameters that characterize the optional error model.

- name: num_integrity
  type: uint8
  description: >
    Number of integrity values.

- name: integrity
  type: type_integrity[num_integrity]
  description: >
    Measurement integrity.  Includes the integrity method used and an integrity value (which is to
    be interpreted based upon the integrity method).  The intent of allowing num_integrity > 1 is to
    report multiple integrity values based on multiple integrity methods.
