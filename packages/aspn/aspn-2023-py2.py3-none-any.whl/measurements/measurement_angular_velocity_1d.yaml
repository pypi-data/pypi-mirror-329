version: 2023
system_type: standard
category: measurement
controlled: no
distribution: A
experimental: false
description: |
  Measures the angular velocity about the sense-axis. The sense-axis is the sensor frame x-axis as
  defined in mounting.

fields:
- name: header
  type: type_header
  description: >
    Standard ASPN measurement header.
- name: time_of_validity
  type: type_timestamp
  description: >
    Time at which the measurement is considered to be valid.

- name: sensor_type
  enum:
  - INTEGRATED: Angular velocity integrated over last measurement period expressed as delta rotation
      in radians. Variance units are radians^2. Time of validity is the end of integration period.
      Integration period is from previous measurement to the current measurement.
  - SAMPLED: Angular velocity is sampled expressed in rad/s. Variance units are (rad/s)^2.

  description: >
    Defines an optional error model for other than zero-mean, additive, white Gaussian noise (AWGN).
- name: num_error_model_params
  type: uint16
  description: >
    Number of parameters required for the error model chosen.

  units: various
  description: Error model parameters that characterize the optional error model.

- name: num_integrity
  type: uint8
  description: >
    Number of integrity values.

- name: integrity
  type: type_integrity[num_integrity]
  description: >
    Measurement integrity.  Includes the integrity method used and an integrity value (which is to
    be interpreted based upon the integrity method).  The intent of allowing num_integrity > 1 is to
    report multiple integrity values based on multiple integrity methods.
