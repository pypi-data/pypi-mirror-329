fields:
- name: header
  type: type_header
  description: >
    Standard ASPN measurement header.
- name: time_of_validity
  type: type_timestamp
  description: >
    Time at which the measurement is considered to be valid.

- name: time_of_validity_attosec
  type: int32
  units: attoseconds
  description: >
    Whole number of attoseconds used to provide additional timestamp fidelity describing the time at
    which the measurement is considered to be valid.  This is only needed if the time of validity is
    known to more precision than 1ns; otherwise, set time_of_validity_attosec = 0.  Be sure to
    report the timestamp's digits of precision in the `type_metadataheader` as part of the metadata.

    The full timestamp in nanoseconds is calculated as

           time_of_validity + ( time_of_validity_attosec * 1E-9 )

    and if needed, a timestamp in seconds is calculated as

           time_of_validity * 1E-9 + time_of_validity_attosec * 1E-18

    (Recall time_of_validity is in nanoseconds and time_of_validity_attosec is in attoseconds.)
    Furthermore, both time_of_validity and time_of_validity_attosec are signed integers and may be
    positive or negative.  It is recommended to make time_of_validity and time_of_validity_attosec
    the same sign. Care should be taken when constructing the timestamp components to be sure the
    summation produces the desired result.

- name: clock_id1
  type: uint8
  description: >
    Identifier for clock/timing source 1.  See clock_identifiers.md for a full description, but the 
    summary is as follows:
      0 = ASPN System Time
      1 = International Atomic Time (TAI)
      2 = Universal Coordinated Time (UTC)
      3 = GPS System Time
      4 = Galileo System Time
      5 = GLONASS System Time
      6 = BeiDou System Time
      7-50: Reserved for future additional time scale representations.

- name: clock_id2
  type: uint8
  description: >
    Identifier for clock/timing source 2.  See clock_identifiers.md for a full description, but the 
    summary is as follows:
      0 = ASPN System Time

- name: freq_diff
  type: float64
  units: Hertz
  description: >
    Frequency difference formed as (frequency from clock_id1) - (frequency from clock_id2).

- name: variance
  type: float64
  units: Hertz^2
  description:
    Variance of the error in the frequency difference measurement.

- name: error_model
  enum:
  - NONE: No additional error model provided (num_error_model_params = 0).
  length: 32
  description: >
    Defines an optional error model for other than zero-mean, additive, white Gaussian noise (AWGN).

- name: num_error_model_params
  type: uint16
  description: >
    Number of parameters required for the error model chosen.

- name: error_model_params
  type: float64[num_error_model_params]
  units: various
  description: >
    Error model parameters that characterize the optional error model.

- name: num_integrity
  type: uint8
  description: >
    Number of integrity values.

- name: integrity
  type: type_integrity[num_integrity]
  description: >
    Measurement integrity.  Includes the integrity method used and an integrity value (which is to
    be interpreted based upon the integrity method).  The intent of allowing num_integrity > 1 is to
    report multiple integrity values based on multiple integrity methods.
