name: measurement_specific_force_1d
version: 2023
system_type: standard
category: measurement
controlled: no
distribution: A
experimental: false
description: >
  Measures the apparent specific force along the sense-axis. Example sensors are an atomic
  interferometer, quantum gravimeter, or accelerometer. The apparent specific force is corrupted by
  inertial (Coriolis and Centrifugal) effects. The sense-axis is the sensor frame x-axis as defined
  in mounting.

fields:
- name: header
  type: type_header
  description: >
    Standard ASPN measurement header.
- name: time_of_validity
  type: type_timestamp
  description: >
    Time at which the measurement is considered to be valid.

- name: sensor_type
  enum:
  - INTEGRATED: >
      Specific force integrated over last measurement period expressed as delta velocity in m/s.
      Variance units are (m/s)^2. Time of validity is the end of integration period. Integration
      period is from previous measurement to the current measurement.
  - SAMPLED: Specific force is sampled expressed in m/s/s. Variance units are (m/s/s)^2.

- name: error_model
  enum:
  - NONE: No additional error model provided (num_error_model_params = 0).
  length: 32
  description: >
    Defines an optional error model for other than zero-mean, additive, white Gaussian noise (AWGN).

- name: num_error_model_params
  type: uint16
  description: >
    Number of parameters required for the error model chosen.

- name: error_model_params
  type: float64[num_error_model_params]
  units: various
  description: Error model parameters that characterize the optional error model.

- name: num_integrity
  type: uint8
  description: >
    Number of integrity values.

- name: integrity
  type: type_integrity[num_integrity]
  description: >
    Measurement integrity.  Includes the integrity method used and an integrity value (which is to
    be interpreted based upon the integrity method).  The intent of allowing num_integrity > 1 is to
    report multiple integrity values based on multiple integrity methods.
