  Raw measurements from a satnav receiver.

fields:
- name: header
  type: type_header
  description: >
    Standard ASPN measurement header.
- name: time_of_validity
  type: type_timestamp
  description: >
    Time at which the measurement is considered to be valid.
- name: receiver_clock_time
  type: type_satnav_time
  description: >
    Receiver clock time.  In a multi-GNSS receiver (GPS/GLONASS/Galileo/QZSS/BeiDou) all pseudorange
    observations must refer to one receiver clock only.   The receiver clock time of the measurement
    is the receiver clock time of the received signals.  It is identical for the phase and range
    measurements and is identical for all satellites observed in a given epoch.
- name: num_signal_types
  type: uint16
  description: >
    Number of different signal types tracked in the current epoch.  Examples of signal types include
    GPS L1 C/A code, Galileo E1B.
- name: num_signals_tracked
  type: uint16
  description: >
    Total number of signals tracked across all PRNs and signal types.
- name: obs
  type: type_satnav_obs[num_signals_tracked]
  description: Array of satnav obs data for all of the signals/PRNs being tracked in this epoch.

- name: num_integrity
  type: uint8
  description: >
    Number of integrity values.

- name: integrity
  type: type_integrity[num_integrity]
  description: >
    Measurement integrity at the sensor level.  Integrity is also available for each observable,
    which is found in the observable type definition.  Includes the integrity method used and an
    integrity value (which is to be interpreted based upon the integrity method).  The intent of
    allowing num_integrity > 1 is to report multiple integrity values based on multiple integrity
    methods.
