name: measurement_range_rate_to_point
version: 2023
system_type: standard
category: measurement
controlled: no
distribution: A
experimental: false
description: >
  Range rate to a point is the instantaneous rate of change in the distance between the sensor and
  the point at time_of_validity.  Information about the remote point (its position and/or
  correspondence with previous or future appearances of this same point) may be determined using
  remote_point.

fields:
- name: header
  type: type_header
  description: >
    Standard ASPN measurement header.
- name: time_of_validity
  type: type_timestamp
  description: >
    Time at which the measurement is considered to be valid.

- name: remote_point
  type: type_remote_point
  units: various
  description: >
    Position and/or correspondence information about the remote point.

- name: obs
  type: float64
  units: m/s
  description: >
    Range rate to the remote point.

- name: variance
  type: float64
  units: (m/s)^2
  description: >
    Variance of the range rate measurement.

- name: error_model
  enum:
  - NONE: No additional error model provided (num_error_model_params = 0).
  length: 32
  description: >
    Defines an optional error model for other than zero-mean, additive, white
    Gaussian noise (AWGN).

- name: num_error_model_params
  type: uint16
  description: >
    Number of parameters required for the error model chosen.

- name: error_model_params
  type: float64[num_error_model_params]
  units: various
  description: >
    Error model parameters that characterize the optional error model.

- name: num_integrity
  type: uint8
  description: >
    Number of integrity values.

- name: integrity
  type: type_integrity[num_integrity]
  description: >
    Measurement integrity.  Includes the integrity method used and an integrity value (which is to
    be interpreted based upon the integrity method).  The intent of allowing num_integrity > 1 is to
    report multiple integrity values based on multiple integrity methods.
