  Speed is the magnitude of the velocity vector with respect to the user-specified reference frame.

fields:
- name: header
  type: type_header
  description: >
    Standard ASPN measurement header.
- name: time_of_validity
  type: type_timestamp
  description: >
        Time at which the measurement is considered to be valid.

- name: reference
  enum:
  - TAS: >
      Speed with respect to air measured as true airspeed (TAS) with respect to air mass expressed
      in sensor coordinate frame.
  - IAS: >
      Speed with respect to air measured as indicated airspeed (IAS) with respect to air mass
      expressed in sensor coordinate frame; for example, dynamic pressure from a pitot tube
      converted to airspeed without compensation for instrument error, position, altitude, or
      temperature.
  - WATER: >
      Speed with respect to water. Speed with respect to water expressed in sensor coordinate frame.
  - GROUND: Speed with respect to ground. An example source is a ground Doppler radar.
  length: 8
  description: >
    Defines measurement reference.

- name: speed
  type: float64
  units: m/s
  description: >
    Speed as the magnitude of the velocity.

- name: variance
  type: float64
  units: (m/s)^2
  description: Speed variance.


- name: error_model
  enum:
  - NONE: No additional error model provided (num_error_model_params = 0).
  length: 32
  description: >
    Defines an optional error model for other than zero-mean, additive, white Gaussian noise (AWGN).

- name: num_error_model_params
  type: uint16
  description: >
    Number of parameters required for the error model chosen.

- name: error_model_params
  type: float64[num_error_model_params]
  units: various
  description: >
    Error model parameters that characterize the optional error model.

- name: num_integrity
  type: uint8
  description: >
    Number of integrity values.

- name: integrity
  type: type_integrity[num_integrity]
  description: >
    Measurement integrity.  Includes the integrity method used and an integrity value (which is to
    be interpreted based upon the integrity method).  The intent of allowing num_integrity > 1 is to
    report multiple integrity values based on multiple integrity methods.
