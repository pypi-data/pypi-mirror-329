- name: freq_slot_id
  type: int32

- name: data_vector
  type: int8[num_bytes]
  description: >
    num_bytes sized array of raw subframe message collected by the sensor. The underlying type and
    shape of the data vector is given by satnav_msg_id.

- name: num_integrity
  type: uint8
  description: >
    Number of integrity values.

- name: integrity
  type: type_integrity[num_integrity]
  description: >
    Measurement integrity.  Includes the integrity method used and an integrity value (which is to
    be interpreted based upon the integrity method).  The intent of allowing num_integrity > 1 is to
