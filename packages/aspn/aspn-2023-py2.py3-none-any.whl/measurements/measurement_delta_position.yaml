description: >
  Delta position is the change in position from the position at time (time_of_validity - delta_t) to
  the position at time (time_of_validity), where the change in position is reported along each axis
  of the reference frame.  The reference frame is chosen by the user in the reference enum.

fields:
- name: header
  type: type_header
  description: >
    Standard ASPN measurement header.
- name: time_of_validity
  type: type_timestamp
  description: >
    Time at which the measurement is considered to be valid at the end of the delta-position period.

- name: reference_frame
  enum:
  - NED: >
      Change in position along the N, E, and D axes of the locally level NED frame.  Each direction
      is optional.  term1, term2, and term3, if provided, describe the change in position along the
      N, E, and D axes, respectively. For example, a depth sensor may report a change in position of
      +2m along the D axis by omitting term1 and term2 (using the appropriate null) and using term3
      = 2. This observation may be interpreted as (1) the sensor has no knowledge of the change in
      position in the N and E directions, and (2) the sensor observed that the position at the end
      of the observation time interval, time_of_validity, is 2 meters lower than the position at the
      start of the time interval, time_of_validity - delta_t.  See also NED coordinate frame
      definition for N, E, and D definitions.
  - SENSOR_START: >
      Change in position expressed in the sensor frame at the start of the measurement interval as
      defined in mounting.  Each direction is optional. term1, term2, and term3, if provided,
      describe the change in position along the sensor x, y, and z axes, respectively.
  - SENSOR_END: >
      Change in position expressed in the sensor frame at the end of the measurement interval as
      defined in mounting.  Each direction is optional. term1, term2, and term3, if provided,
      describe the change in position along the sensor x, y, and z axes, respectively.
  length: 8
  description: >
    Specifies measurement reference frame.

- name: delta_t
  type: float64
  units: sec
  description: >
    Duration of the observation time interval. The time_of_validity denotes the end of the time
    interval. The start of the time interval is time_of_validity - delta_t.

- name: num_meas
  type: uint8
  description: >
    Dimension of measurement provided.

- name: term1
  type: float64?
  units: m
  description: >
    Delta position over the first dimension specified by the enum.
- name: term2
  type: float64?
  units: m
  description: >
    Delta position over the second dimension specified by the enum.
- name: term3
  type: float64?
  units: m
  description: >
    Delta position over the third dimension specified by the enum.

- name: covariance
  type: float64[num_meas, num_meas]
  units: m^2
  description: >
    Variance or covariance matrix depending on measurement dimension.

- name: error_model
  enum:
  - NONE: No additional error model provided (num_error_model_params = 0).
  length: 32
  description: >
    Defines an optional error model for other than zero-mean, additive, white Gaussian noise (AWGN).
- name: num_error_model_params
  type: uint16
  description: >
    Number of parameters required for the error model chosen.
- name: error_model_params
  type: float64[num_error_model_params]
  units: various
  description: >
    Error model parameters that characterize the optional error model.

- name: num_integrity
  type: uint8
  description: >
    Number of integrity values.

- name: integrity
  type: type_integrity[num_integrity]
  description: >
    Measurement integrity.  Includes the integrity method used and an integrity value (which is to
    be interpreted based upon the integrity method).  The intent of allowing num_integrity > 1 is to
    report multiple integrity values based on multiple integrity methods.
