version: 2023
system_type: standard
category: measurement
controlled: no
distribution: A
experimental: false
description: |
  Time difference of arrival of two signals (Tx) to a sensor (Rx).

fields:
- name: header
  type: type_header
  description: >
    Standard ASPN measurement header.
- name: time_of_validity
  type: type_timestamp
  description: >
        Time at which the measurement is considered to be valid.

- name: Tx1_position_and_covariance
  type: type_remote_point
  description: >
    Transmitter 1 (Tx1)'s known location.

- name: Tx2_position_and_covariance
  type: type_remote_point
  description: >
    Transmitter 2 (Tx2)'s known location.

- name: obs
  type: float64
  units: m
  description: >
    Time difference of arrival (in meters).  Time difference of Tx1 signal's
    arrival time minus Tx2 signal's arrival time at the sensor. Positive
    obs indicates Tx1 arrived later than Tx2.

- name: variance
  type: float64
  units: m^2
  description: >
    Measurement variance.

- name: error_model
  enum:
  - NONE: No additional error model provided (num_error_model_params = 0).
  length: 32
  description: >
    Defines an optional error model for other than zero-mean, additive, white Gaussian noise (AWGN).

- name: num_error_model_params
  type: uint16
  description: >
    Number of parameters required for the error model chosen.

- name: error_model_params
  type: float64[num_error_model_params]
  units: various
  description: >
    Error model parameters that characterize the optional error model.

- name: num_integrity
  type: uint8
  description: >
    Number of integrity values.

- name: integrity
  type: type_integrity[num_integrity]
  description: >
    Measurement integrity.  Includes the integrity method used and an integrity value (which is to
    be interpreted based upon the integrity method).  The intent of allowing num_integrity > 1 is to
    report multiple integrity values based on multiple integrity methods.
