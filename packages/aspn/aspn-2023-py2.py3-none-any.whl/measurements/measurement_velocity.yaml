description: >
  Velocity is time rate of change of position with respect to the user-specified reference frame.
  May be one, two, or three dimensional.

fields:
- name: header
  type: type_header
  description: >
    Standard ASPN measurement header.
- name: time_of_validity
  type: type_timestamp
  description: >
    Time at which the measurement is considered to be valid.
- name: reference_frame
  enum:
  - ECI: >
      Velocity with respect to earth-centered inertial frame, expressed in an earth-centered
      inertial frame. See also ECi coordinate frame definition for x, y, and z definitions.
  - ECEF: >
      Velocity with respect to earth-fixed frame expressed in earth-centered, earth-fixed (ECEF)
      frame. See also ECEF coordinate frame definition for x, y, and z definitions.
  - NED: >
      Local level, geodetic velocity: Velocity with respect to earth-fixed frame expressed in the
      North-East-Down (NED), local level frame.  See also NED coordinate frame definition for N, E,
      and D definitions.
  - SENSOR: >
      Velocity with respect to earth-fixed frame expressed in sensor coordinate frame. Sensor
      coordinate frame is defined in sensor metadataHeader.
  length: 32
  description: >
    Defines measurement reference.

- name: x
  type: float64?
  units: m/s
  description: >
    Velocity along the first axis of the measurement reference frame enumerated in reference_frame.

- name: y
  type: float64?
  units: m/s
  description: >
    Velocity along the second axis of the measurement reference frame enumerated in reference_frame.

- name: z
  type: float64?
  units: m/s
  description: >
    Velocity along the third axis of the measurement reference frame enumerated in reference_frame.

- name: num_meas
  type: uint8
  description: >
    Dimension of measurement provided.

- name: covariance
  type: float64[num_meas, num_meas]
  units: (m/s)^2
  description: Measurement error covariance or variance depending on measurement dimension.

- name: error_model
  enum:
  - NONE: No additional error model provided (num_error_model_params = 0).
  length: 32
  description: >
    Defines an optional error model for other than zero-mean, additive, white Gaussian noise (AWGN).

- name: num_error_model_params
  type: uint16
  description: >
    Number of parameters required for the error model chosen.

- name: error_model_params
  type: float64[num_error_model_params]
  units: various
  description: >
    Error model parameters that characterize the optional error model.

- name: num_integrity
  type: uint8
  description: >
    Number of integrity values.

- name: integrity
  type: type_integrity[num_integrity]
  description: >
    Measurement integrity.  Includes the integrity method used and an integrity value (which is to
    be interpreted based upon the integrity method).  The intent of allowing num_integrity > 1 is to
    report multiple integrity values based on multiple integrity methods.
