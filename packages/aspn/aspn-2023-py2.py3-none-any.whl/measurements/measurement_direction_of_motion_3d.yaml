fields:
- name: header
  type: type_header
  description: >
    Standard ASPN measurement header.
- name: time_of_validity
  type: type_timestamp
  description: >
    Time at which the measurement is considered to be valid.

- name: reference_frame
  enum:
  - ECI: >
      Direction of motion with respect to earth-centered inertial (ECi) frame, expressed in an
      earth-centered inertial frame. See also ECi coordinate frame definition for x, y, and z
      definitions.
  - ECEF: >
      Direction of motion with respect to earth-fixed frame expressed in earth-centered, earth-fixed
      (ECEF) frame. See also ECEF coordinate frame definition for x, y, and z definitions.
  - NED: >
      Local level, geodetic velocity: Velocity with respect to earth-fixed frame expressed in the
      North-East-Down (NED), local level frame.  See also NED coordinate frame definition for N, E,
      and D definitions.
  - SENSOR: >
      Direction of motion with respect to earth-fixed frame expressed in sensor coordinate frame.
      Sensor coordinate frame is defined in sensor metadataHeader.
  length: 8
  description: >
    Defines measurement reference.

- name: obs
  type: float64[3]
  description: >
    Direction of motion represented as a unit vector.

- name: error_vector
  type: float64[3]
  description: >
    Error is expressed as rotation uncertainty about two axes, error_vector and
    and a second error vector that is orthogonal to both the obs vector and the error_vector.

- name: covariance
  type: float64[2, 2]
  units: rad^2
  description: >
    Error is expressed as rotation uncertainty about the following two axes: 1) error_vector, and 2)
    a second error vector that is orthogonal to both the obs direction vector and the error_vector.

- name: error_model
  enum:
  - NONE: No additional error model provided (num_error_model_params = 0).
  length: 32
  description: >
    Defines an optional error model for other than zero-mean, additive, white Gaussian noise (AWGN).

- name: num_error_model_params
  type: uint16
  description: >
    Number of parameters required for the error model chosen.

- name: error_model_params
  type: float64[num_error_model_params]
  units: various
  description: >
    Error model parameters that characterize the optional error model.

- name: num_integrity
  type: uint8
  description: >
    Number of integrity values.

- name: integrity
  type: type_integrity[num_integrity]
  description: >
    Measurement integrity.  Includes the integrity method used and an integrity value (which is to
    be interpreted based upon the integrity method).  The intent of allowing num_integrity > 1 is to
    report multiple integrity values based on multiple integrity methods.
