name: measurement_TDOA_1Tx_2Rx
version: 2023
system_type: standard
category: measurement
controlled: no
distribution: A
experimental: false
description: |
  Time difference of arrival of a single transmitter (Tx) to two receivers.
  Receiver 1 (Rx1) is at a known location.  Receiver 2 is the sensor system
  providing the measurement.

fields:
- name: header
  type: type_header
  description: >
    Standard ASPN measurement header.
- name: time_of_validity
  type: type_timestamp
  description: >
        Time at which the measurement is considered to be valid.


- name: Tx_position_and_covariance
  type: type_remote_point
  description: >
    Transmitter (Tx)'s known location.

- name: Rx1_position_and_covariance
  type: type_remote_point
  description: >
    Receiver 1 (Rx1)'s known location.

- name: obs
  type: float64
  units: m
  description: >
    Time difference of arrival (in meters).  Time difference of Tx signal's
    arrival time at Rx1 minus Tx signal's arrival time at the sensor. Positive
    obs indicates Tx arrived at Rx1 later than arriving at the sensor.

- name: variance
  type: float64
  units: m^2
  description: >
    Measurement variance.

- name: error_model
  enum:
  - NONE: No additional error model provided (num_error_model_params = 0).
  length: 32
  description: >
    Defines an optional error model for other than zero-mean, additive, white Gaussian noise (AWGN).

- name: num_error_model_params
  type: uint16
  description: >
    Number of parameters required for the error model chosen.

- name: error_model_params
  type: float64[num_error_model_params]
  units: various
  description: >
    Error model parameters that characterize the optional error model.

- name: num_integrity
  type: uint8
  description: >
    Number of integrity values.

- name: integrity
  type: type_integrity[num_integrity]
  description: >
    Measurement integrity.  Includes the integrity method used and an integrity value (which is to
    be interpreted based upon the integrity method).  The intent of allowing num_integrity > 1 is to
    report multiple integrity values based on multiple integrity methods.
