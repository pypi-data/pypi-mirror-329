  Delta range to a point is the difference, d1 - d0, where

    d1 is the distance between the sensor and the point at time = (time_of_validity)
    d0 is the distance between the sensor and the point at time = (time_of_validity - delta_t)

  Note, a negative obs indicates the sensor is closer to the point at time_of_validity than it was
  at time_of_validity - delta_t.  Information about the remote point (its position and/or
  correspondence with previous or future appearances of this same point) may be determined using
  remote_point.

fields:

    Standard ASPN measurement header.
- name: time_of_validity
  type: type_timestamp
  description: >
    Time at which the measurement is considered to be valid.

- name: remote_point
  type: type_remote_point
  units: various
  description: >
    Position and/or correspondence information about the remote point.

- name: obs
  type: float64
  units: m
  description: >
    Delta range to the remote point.

- name: delta_t
  type: float64
  units: sec
  description: >
    Duration of the observation time interval. The time_of_validity denotes the end of the time
    interval. The start of the time interval is time_of_validity - delta_t.

- name: variance

  description: >
    Variance of the delta range measurement.

  enum:
  - NONE: No additional error model provided (num_error_model_params = 0).
  length: 32
  description: >
    Defines an optional error model for other than zero-mean, additive, white
    Gaussian noise (AWGN).
- name: num_error_model_params
  type: uint16
  description: >
    Number of parameters required for the error model chosen.
- name: error_model_params

  units: various
  description: >
    Error model parameters that characterize the optional error model.

- name: num_integrity
  type: uint8
  description: >
    Number of integrity values.

- name: integrity
  type: type_integrity[num_integrity]
  description: >
    Measurement integrity.  Includes the integrity method used and an integrity value (which is to
    be interpreted based upon the integrity method).  The intent of allowing num_integrity > 1 is to
    report multiple integrity values based on multiple integrity methods.
