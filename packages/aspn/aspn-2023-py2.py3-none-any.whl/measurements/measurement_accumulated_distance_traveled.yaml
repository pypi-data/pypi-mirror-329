name: measurement_accumulated_distance_traveled
version: 2023
system_type: standard
category: measurement
controlled: no
distribution: A
experimental: false
description: >
  Accumulated distance traveled over the time period from (time_of_validity - delta_t) to
  time_of_validity.  For example, a sensor that travels (over the observation time period) in one
  direction 1m and reverses course to travel 1m back (and ends at its starting position) would have
  an accumulated distance traveled of 2m.  Sensor examples may include an odometer or a wheel
  encoder.

fields:
- name: header
  type: type_header
  description: >
    Standard ASPN measurement header.
- name: time_of_validity
  type: type_timestamp
  description: >
    Time at which the measurement is considered to be valid.

- name: delta_t
  type: float64
  units: sec
  description: >
    Duration of the observation time interval. The time_of_validity denotes the end of the time
    interval. The start of the time interval is time_of_validity - delta_t.
- name: obs
  type: float64
  units: m
  description: >
    Accumulated distance traveled over time period.
- name: variance
  type: float64
  units: m^2
  description: >
    Accumulated distance traveled variance.

- name: error_model
  enum:
  - NONE: No additional error model provided (num_error_model_params = 0).
  length: 32
  description: >
    Defines an optional error model for other than zero-mean, additive, white Gaussian noise (AWGN).
- name: num_error_model_params
  type: uint16
  description: >
    Number of parameters required for the error model chosen.
- name: error_model_params
  type: float64[num_error_model_params]
  units: various
  description: >
    Error model parameters that characterize the optional error model.

- name: num_integrity
  type: uint8
  description: >
    Number of integrity values.

- name: integrity
  type: type_integrity[num_integrity]
  description: >
    Measurement integrity.  Includes the integrity method used and an integrity value (which is to
    be interpreted based upon the integrity method).  The intent of allowing num_integrity > 1 is to
    report multiple integrity values based on multiple integrity methods.
