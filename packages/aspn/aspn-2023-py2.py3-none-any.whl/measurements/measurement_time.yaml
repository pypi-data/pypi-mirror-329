  Expresses time measurements from one or more clocks/timing sources.

fields:
- name: header
  type: type_header
  description: >
    Standard ASPN measurement header.
- name: time_of_validity
  type: type_timestamp
  description: >
        Time at which the measurement is considered to be valid.

- name: time_of_validity_attosec
  type: int32
  units: attoseconds
  description: >
    Whole number of attoseconds used to provide additional timestamp fidelity describing the time at
    which the measurement is considered to be valid.  This is only needed if the time of validity is
    known to more precision than 1ns; otherwise, set time_of_validity_attosec = 0.  Be sure to
    report the timestamp's digits of precision in the `type_metadataheader` as part of the metadata.

    The full timestamp in nanoseconds is calculated as

           time_of_validity + ( time_of_validity_attosec * 1E-9 )

    and if needed, a timestamp in seconds is calculated as

           time_of_validity * 1E-9 + time_of_validity_attosec * 1E-18

    (Recall time_of_validity is in nanoseconds and time_of_validity_attosec is in attoseconds.)
    Furthermore, both time_of_validity and time_of_validity_attosec are signed integers and may be
    positive or negative.  It is recommended to make time_of_validity and time_of_validity_attosec
    the same sign. Care should be taken when constructing the timestamp components to be sure the
    summation produces the desired result.

- name: num_obs
  type: uint8
  description: >
    Number of absolute clock/timing source measurements reported in this measurement. May be 0
    through 255.  The clock_id, elapsed_nsec, and elapsed_attosec values are provided for each
    measurement, indexed by the observation number.

- name: clock_id
  type: uint8[num_obs]
  description: >
    Identifier for clock/timing source for each measurement.  See clock_identifiers.md for a full 
    description, but the summary is as follows:
      0 = ASPN System Time
      1 = International Atomic Time (TAI)
      2 = Universal Coordinated Time (UTC)
      3 = GPS System Time
      4 = Galileo System Time
      5 = GLONASS System Time
      6 = BeiDou System Time
      7-50: Reserved for future additional time scale representations.

- name: elapsed_nsec
  type: int64[num_obs]
  units: nanoseconds
  description: >
    Whole number nanoseconds elapsed since each clock's zero epoch.  If negative, whole number
    nanoseconds until each clock's zero epoch.  Additionally, the timestamp's digits of precision
    are included as `digits_of_precision`.

- name: elapsed_attosec
  type: int32[num_obs]
  units: attoseconds
  description: >
    Whole number of attoseconds used to provide additional observation fidelity.  This is only
    needed if the observation is known to more precision than 1ns; otherwise, set
    time_of_validity_attosec = 0.  Be sure to report the timestamp's digits of precision.

    The full observation in nanoseconds is calculated as

           elapsed_nsec + ( elapsed_attosec * 1E-9 )

    and the observation in seconds is calculated as

           elapsed_nsec * 1E-9 + elapsed_attosec * 1E-18

    Furthermore, both elapsed_nsec and elapsed_attosec are signed integers and may be positive or
    negative.  It is recommended to make elapsed_nsec and elapsed_attosec the same sign. Care should
    be taken when constructing the observation components to be sure the summation produces the
    desired result.

- name: digits_of_precision
  type: uint8
  description: >
     Defines how many decimal digits of precision are represented in the observation after the
     decimal point.  The precision of the observation is 10E-N, where N is digits_of_precision.  A
     value of 3 would mean that the observation has precision at the 10E-3 (millisecond) level, a
     value of 6 would mean the observation has precision at the 10E-6 (microsecond) level, etc.

- name: covariance
  type: float64[num_obs, num_obs]
  units: sec^2
  description: >
    Measurement error variance or covariance depending on measurement dimension in the absolute
    clock/timing signal measurements.  Note: These measurements are assuming that there is no error
    in the ASPN system clock.  Errors in the     ASPN system clock time tag for the time
    measurements should be included in the overall errors for the respective time measurements as
    expressed in the covariance matrix.

- name: error_model
  enum:
  - NONE: No additional error model provided (num_error_model_params = 0).
  length: 32
  description: >
    Defines an optional error model for other than zero-mean, additive, white Gaussian noise (AWGN).

- name: num_error_model_params
  type: uint16
  description: >
    Number of parameters required for the error model chosen.

- name: error_model_params
  type: float64[num_error_model_params]
  units: various
  description: >
    Error model parameters that characterize the optional error model.

- name: num_integrity
  type: uint8
  description: >
    Number of integrity values.

- name: integrity
  type: type_integrity[num_integrity]
  description: >
    Measurement integrity.  Includes the integrity method used and an integrity value (which is to
    be interpreted based upon the integrity method).  The intent of allowing num_integrity > 1 is to
    report multiple integrity values based on multiple integrity methods.
