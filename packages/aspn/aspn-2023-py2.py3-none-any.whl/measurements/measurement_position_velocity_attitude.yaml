  Position, velocity, and attitude. Position, in whole or in part, is optional. Velocity, in whole
  or in part, is optional. Attitude is optional, but if included, must be 3-dimensional. Position is
  relative to a user-defined reference frame. Velocity is time rate of change of position with
  respect to the user-specified reference frame. Attitude expressed as a quaternion, a four element
  vector representation, the elements of which are functions of the orientation of the vector and
  the magnitude of the rotation.

- name: reference_frame
  enum:
  - ECI: >
      Sensor position, velocity, and attitude relative to the earth-centered, inertial (ECi) frame.
      Position is expressed where p1, p2, and p3 are the x, y, and z components of ECI position in
      meters, respectively. Velocity is expressed where v1, v2, and v3 are the x, y, and z
      components of velocity with respect to the ECi frame in m/s, respectively. Attitude is
      expressed as a four-element quaternion. Position, in whole or in part, is optional. Velocity,
      in whole or in part, is optional. Attitude is optional, but if included, must be 3
      dimensional. Error covariance is given using x-axis position error component (meters), y-axis
      position error component (meters), z-axis position error component (meters), x-axis velocity
      error component (m/s), y-axis velocity error component (m/s), z-axis velocity error component
      (m/s), tilt error about the x-axis (rad), tilt error about the y-axis (rad), and tilt error
      about the z-axis (rad). In the case of nulled position, velocity, or attitude, the
      corresponding error covariance terms are omitted. See also ECi coordinate frame definition for
      x, y, and z definitions.
  - GEODETIC: >
      Sensor position, velocity, and attitude relative to the WGS-84 reference.  Position is
      expressed where p1 is the geodetic latitude in radians, p2 is the longitude in radians, and p3
      is the geodetic altitude (or height above the WGS-84 ellipsoid) in meters. Velocity with
      respect to the local level geographical frame with the origin at the sensor position is
      expressed using the North-East-Down (NED) convention, where v1 is the north velocity component
      in m/s, v2 is the east velocity component in m/s, and v3 is the down velocity component in
      m/s. Attitude is the sensor frame rotation relative to the local level frame expressed as a
      four-element quaternion.  Position, in whole or in part, is optional. Velocity, in whole or in
      part, is optional. Attitude is optional, but if included, must be 3 dimensional. Error
      covariance is given using north-south position error (meters), east-west position error
      (meters), geodetic altitude error (meters), north velocity component error (m/s), east
      velocity component error (m/s), down velocity component error (m/s), tilt error about the
      north axis (rad), tilt error about the east axis (rad), and tilt error about the down axis
      (rad). In the case of nulled position, velocity, or attitude, the corresponding error
      covariance terms are omitted.

- name: quaternion
  type: float64[4]?
  description: >
    Four element quaternion, q = [a, b, c, d], where a = cos(phi/2), b = (phi_x/phi)*sin(phi/2), c =
    (phi_y/phi)*sin(phi/2), and d = (phi_z/phi)*sin(phi/2).  In this description, the vector [phi_x,
    phi_y, phi_z] represents the rotation vector that describes the frame rotation to be applied to
    the "reference" frame (ECI, ECEF, or NED) to rotate it into the axes that describe the measured
    attitude, and the value phi is the magnitude of the [phi_x, phi_y, phi_z] vector.

- name: num_meas
  type: uint8
  description: >
    Dimension of measurement provided.  In this sense, num_meas is the number of measurement terms
    that include valid data.
- name: covariance
  type: float64[num_meas, num_meas]
  units: various
  description: >
    Measurement error variance or covariance depending on measurement dimension. NOTE: Attitude
    errors are expressed as tilt errors, so if an attitude is provided, that should count as 3 terms
    in num_meas.  For example, a 3-D position, 3-D velocity, and attitude expressed as a quaternion
    (which takes 10 terms total to describe) is num_meas = 9.  A second example is a 3-D position
    and 3-D velocity is num_meas = 6.

- name: integrity
  type: type_integrity[num_integrity]
  description: >
    Measurement integrity.  Includes the integrity method used and an integrity value (which is to
    be interpreted based upon the integrity method).  The intent of allowing num_integrity > 1 is to
    report multiple integrity values based on multiple integrity methods.
