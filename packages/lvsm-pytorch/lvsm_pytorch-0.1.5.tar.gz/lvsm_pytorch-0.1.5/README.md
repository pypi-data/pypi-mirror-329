## LVSM - Pytorch

Implementation of [LVSM](https://haian-jin.github.io/projects/LVSM/), SOTA Large View Synthesis with Minimal 3d Inductive Bias, from Adobe Research

We will focus only on the Decoder-only architecture in this repository.

This paper lines up with <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=A8Vuf2e8y6">another</a> from ICLR 2025

## Install

```bash
$ pip install lvsm-pytorch
```

## Usage

```python
import torch
from lvsm_pytorch import LVSM

rays = torch.randn(2, 4, 6, 256, 256)
images = torch.randn(2, 4, 3, 256, 256)

target_rays = torch.randn(2, 6, 256, 256)
target_images = torch.randn(2, 3, 256, 256)

model = LVSM(
    dim = 512,
    max_image_size = 256,
    patch_size = 32,
    depth = 2,
)

loss = model(
    input_images = images,
    input_rays = rays,
    target_rays = target_rays,
    target_images = target_images
)

loss.backward()

# after much training

pred_images = model(
    input_images = images,
    input_rays = rays,
    target_rays = target_rays,
) # (2, 3, 256, 256)

assert pred_images.shape == target_images.shape
```

Or from the raw camera intrinsic / extrinsics (please submit an issue or pull request if you see an error. new to view synthesis and out of my depths here)

```python
import torch
from lvsm_pytorch import LVSM, CameraWrapper

input_intrinsic_rotation = torch.randn(2, 4, 3, 3)
input_extrinsic_rotation = torch.randn(2, 4, 3, 3)
input_translation = torch.randn(2, 4, 3)
input_uniform_points = torch.randn(2, 4, 3, 256, 256)

target_intrinsic_rotation = torch.randn(2, 3, 3)
target_extrinsic_rotation = torch.randn(2, 3, 3)
target_translation = torch.randn(2, 3)
target_uniform_points = torch.randn(2, 3, 256, 256)

images = torch.randn(2, 4, 4, 256, 256)
target_images = torch.randn(2, 4, 256, 256)

lvsm = LVSM(
    dim = 512,
    max_image_size = 256,
    patch_size = 32,
    channels = 4,
    depth = 2,
)

model = CameraWrapper(lvsm)

loss = model(
    input_intrinsic_rotation = input_intrinsic_rotation,
    input_extrinsic_rotation = input_extrinsic_rotation,
    input_translation = input_translation,
    input_uniform_points = input_uniform_points,
    target_intrinsic_rotation = target_intrinsic_rotation,
    target_extrinsic_rotation = target_extrinsic_rotation,
    target_translation = target_translation,
    target_uniform_points = target_uniform_points,
    input_images = images,
    target_images = target_images,
)

loss.backward()

# after much training

pred_target_images = model(
    input_intrinsic_rotation = input_intrinsic_rotation,
    input_extrinsic_rotation = input_extrinsic_rotation,
    input_translation = input_translation,
    input_uniform_points = input_uniform_points,
    target_intrinsic_rotation = target_intrinsic_rotation,
    target_extrinsic_rotation = target_extrinsic_rotation,
    target_translation = target_translation,
    target_uniform_points = target_uniform_points,
    input_images = images,
)

```

For an improvised self-supervised learning using masked autoencoder for reconstructing images and plucker rays, just import <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06377">`MAE`</a> first and wrap your `LVSM` instance. Then pass in your images and rays

```python
import torch

from lvsm_pytorch import (
    LVSM,
    MAE
)

rays = torch.randn(2, 4, 6, 256, 256)
images = torch.randn(2, 4, 4, 256, 256)

lvsm = LVSM(
    dim = 512,
    max_image_size = 256,
    patch_size = 32,
    channels = 4,
    depth = 2,
    dropout_input_ray_prob = 0.5
)

mae = MAE(
    lvsm = lvsm,
    frac_masked = 0.5,                  # 1 in 2 image/ray pair to be masked out. minimum set to 1
    frac_images_to_ray_masked = 0.5,    # for a given image/ray pair that is masked, the proportion of images being masked vs rays (1. would be only images masked, 0. would be only rays masked). they cannot be both masked
    image_to_ray_loss_weight = 1.       # you can weigh the image recon oss differently than ray recon loss
)

ssl_loss = mae(
    images,
    rays
)

ssl_loss.backward()

# do the above in a loop on a huge amount of data
```

Above with camera in/extrsinsics

```python
import torch

from lvsm_pytorch.lvsm import (
    LVSM,
    MAE,
    MAECameraWrapper
)

intrinsic_rotation = torch.randn(2, 4, 3, 3)
extrinsic_rotation = torch.randn(2, 4, 3, 3)
translation = torch.randn(2, 4, 3)
uniform_points = torch.randn(2, 4, 3, 256, 256)

images = torch.randn(2, 4, 4, 256, 256)

lvsm = LVSM(
    dim = 512,
    max_image_size = 256,
    patch_size = 32,
    channels = 4,
    depth = 2,
)

mae = MAE(lvsm)

model = MAECameraWrapper(mae)

loss = model(
    intrinsic_rotation = intrinsic_rotation,
    extrinsic_rotation = extrinsic_rotation,
    translation = translation,
    uniform_points = uniform_points,
    images = images,
)

loss.backward()
```
