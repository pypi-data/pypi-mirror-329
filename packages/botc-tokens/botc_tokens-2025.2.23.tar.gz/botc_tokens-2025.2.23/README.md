# Token Tools for Blood on the Clocktower
A simple fan-made utility to help create custom tokens for the game Blood on the Clocktower.

![An example of tokens made by this utility](https://github.com/Tsubashi/botc_tokens-Examples/blob/31b118fc96e0f2aaa6b20d7547f2923a6c73ff34/example.jpg?raw=true)

## Installation
To use this tool, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download it from the
[official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once you have Python installed, you can install these scripts using `pip`:
```bash
pip install botc_tokens
```
or manually by cloning this repository and running the following command in the root folder:
```bash
pip install .
```

We use [Wand](https://docs.wand-py.org/en/0.6.13/) to handle image manipulation, which requires the [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php) library to be installed on your 
system. Check the [wand install guide](https://docs.wand-py.org/en/0.6.13/guide/install.html) for details on how to get that set up.

**Note for Apple Silicon:** When running on Apple Silicon, Wand will not auto-detect the ImageMagick installation. 
You will need to set the `MAGICK_HOME` environment variable to your homebrew root, like so:
```bash
export MAGICK_HOME=/opt/homebrew/
```

## Usage
**For a full walkthrough and for more component packages, see the 
[example repository](https://github.com/Tsubashi/botc_tokens-Examples).**

The main script is run through its entrypoint `botc_tokens`. For example, you might use the `update` command to download
the latest assets from the web, and then the `create` command to generate the tokens, followed by a `group` command to 
organize them into a single printable sheet using a json file from the [official script tool](https://script.bloodontheclocktower.com/). 
You can use the `--help` flag to see the available commands and options.

### Updating from the web
If you want to create experimental tokens for your in-person games, you can use the `update` command to download the
current list from the [official wiki](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/). This is an incremental update, so it 
will only download assets that are not already present in the local folder. We highly recommend double-checking the
resulting entries, especially the reminder token section. While the utility does its best to guess, it isn't perfect.
If you already know the reminder tokens, you can create a JSON file for the utility to use. See the 
[example repository](https://github.com/Tsubashi/botc_tokens-Examples) for an example of the format.
```bash
botc_tokens update --output-dir /path/to/inputs --reminders /path/to/reminders.json
```

### Creating tokens
Once you have your role info, whether from the `update` command or from your own creation, you can use the `create`
command to generate the tokens. This will create a folder with the role name and a subfolder for each token type. If you
would like to customize the appearance of the tokens, you can use the `--component-dir` option to specify where to
find your custom components. Check the [example repository](https://github.com/Tsubashi/botc_tokens-Examples) 
for an example of the expected structure.
```bash
botc_tokens create /path/to/inputs -o /path/to/tokens --components /path/to/components
```

### Grouping tokens
Once you have created your token images, you can use the `group` command to organize the tokens into a single 
printable sheet. This command can take a directory or a JSON file with desired role grouping, which follows the
formatting of the [official script tool](https://script.bloodontheclocktower.com/).

```bash
botc_tokens group /path/to/script.json --token-dir /path/to/tokens --output-dir /path/to/printables
```

## And that's it!
You can now print your tokens and use them in your games. Remember, this is a fan-made utility and is not
affiliated with the official game in any way. We do not own the rights to the game, and we do not claim to. We are just
fans who want to make the game more accessible to everyone. Please support the creators by
