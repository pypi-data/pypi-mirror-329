"""Provide functionality to log parameters from Hydra configuration objects.

This module provides functions to log parameters from Hydra configuration objects
to MLflow, set experiments, and manage tracking URIs. It integrates Hydra's
configuration management with MLflow's experiment tracking capabilities.

Key Features:
- **Experiment Management**: Set experiment names and tracking URIs using Hydra
  configuration details.
- **Parameter Logging**: Log parameters from Hydra configuration objects to MLflow,
  supporting both synchronous and asynchronous logging.
- **Run Collection**: Utilize the `RunCollection` class to manage and interact with
  multiple MLflow runs, providing methods to filter and retrieve runs based on
  various criteria.

            machine.
        order_by (list[str] | None): List of columns to order by (e.g.,
            "metrics.rmse"). The ``order_by`` column can contain an optional
            ``DESC`` or ``ASC`` value. The default is ``ASC``. The default
