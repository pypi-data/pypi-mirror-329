## Gemerald markdown ##

Gemerald uses special flavour of Markdown. It is more restrictive then Github-flavoured Markdown.
It is due to the fact that Gemini markup is more restrictive.
Some opinionated choices were made along the way.

Full descrition of Gemerald Markdown is available in [capabilities](docs/capabilities.md) page.
