<p>this might be a <b>bold</b> text but we all know its true</p>
<p>btw, alternative syntax for __bold__ text is not supported. You cannot use __ to denote bold. Remember to use **bold** this way.</p>
<p>The result will truely by <b>**bold**</b>.</p>

<p>^^ the above is not compatible with normal markdown but here quotes end as soon as you stop begging lines with ></p>
<p>Also, authors are parsed. If the line after a quote begins with tilde, it means this is an author of that quote.</p>

<p>oh no, corpos attack! Seriously why do we have to be ruled by some idiots with a bit of luck:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you really care about people wellbeing and set yourself better goals then money, you're not staying afloat in current system. This is common knowledge at this point</li>
<li>Every person in <i>your</i> company is putting a brick towards it's success: 1. Even if you're the most productive person in the entire company the collective effort of all workers probably outweight yours by a long shot. 2. I have doubts you are really the most productive. 3. What is that? Without you this company would not exist? Are you really a "free market" believer?</li>
<li>Please read more on these keywords: - doocracy - merithocracy - cooperatives - workplace democracy - equality vs equity or as someone from FOSDEM called it "suppocracy". I really liked that talk.</li>
<li>Even you, CEO of a big company - You will feel pressured until you climb to the very top of the ladder you're climbing. Do you actually hope to be there? Chances are low.</li>
