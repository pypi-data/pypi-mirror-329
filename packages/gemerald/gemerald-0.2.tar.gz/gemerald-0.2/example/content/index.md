this might be a **bold** text
but we all know its true

btw, alternative syntax for __bold__ text is 
not supported. You cannot use `__` to denote
bold. Remember to use \*\*bold\*\* this way.

The result will truely by **\*\*bold\*\***.

As you can see you gotta be cat to use markdown.

^^ the above is  not compatible with normal markdown
but here quotes end as soon as you stop begging lines
with >

Also, authors are parsed.
If the line after a quote begins with tilde, it means this is an author of that quote.

> And this is also a quote. You can use `code` in quotes too.
This line is not a quote

oh no, corpos attack! Seriously why do we have to be ruled by
some idiots with a bit of luck:

 1. If you really care about people wellbeing and set yourself better goals
    then money, you're not staying afloat in current system. This is
    common knowledge at this point
 2. Every person in *your* company is putting a brick towards it's success:
    1. Even if you're the most productive person in the entire company the
       collective effort of all workers probably outweight yours by a long
       shot.
    2. I have doubts you are really the most productive.
    3. What is that? Without you this company would not exist? Are you really a
       "free market" believer?
 3. Please read more on these keywords:
    - doocracy
    - merithocracy
    - cooperatives
    - workplace democracy
    - equality vs equity or as someone from FOSDEM called it "suppocracy". I
      really liked that talk.
 4. Even you, CEO of a big company - You will feel pressured until you climb to
    the very top of the ladder you're climbing. Do you actually hope to be
    there? Chances are low.
