Architecture
============

The ``memories-dev`` framework is designed with a modular, layered architecture that enables flexible integration of various data sources, processing capabilities, and applications. This page provides an overview of the system architecture and explains how the different components work together.

System Overview
=============

At a high level, the ``memories-dev`` framework consists of four main layers:

1. **Data Acquisition Layer**: Responsible for retrieving data from various sources, including satellite imagery, historical maps, GIS data, and more.
2. **Memory Management Layer**: Manages the storage, retrieval, and organization of temporal and spatial data.
3. **Model Integration Layer**: Integrates various AI models for analyzing and processing the data.
4. **Application Layer**: Provides domain-specific applications built on top of the framework.

Cross-Cutting Concerns
====================

Several components and services span across all layers of the architecture:

Configuration System
------------------

A centralized configuration system that allows customization of all aspects of the framework:

.. code-block:: python

   from memories.config import config, update_config
   
   # Update configuration
   update_config({
       "data_sources.satellite.default_provider": "sentinel",
       "processing.use_gpu": True,
       "storage.cache_size_gb": 5
   })

Logging and Monitoring
--------------------

Comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities:

.. code-block:: python

   from memories.logging import logger
   
   # Log events at different levels
   logger.debug("Detailed debugging information")
   logger.info("General information about operation")
   logger.warning("Warning about potential issues")
   logger.error("Error that occurred during operation")

Error Handling
------------

Robust error handling throughout the framework:

.. code-block:: python

   from memories.errors import DataSourceError, ProcessingError
   
   try:
       result = await process_data(data)
   except DataSourceError as e:
       logger.error(f"Data source error: {e}")
       # Handle data source error
   except ProcessingError as e:
       logger.error(f"Processing error: {e}")
       # Handle processing error

Concurrency Management
-------------------

Tools for managing asynchronous operations and concurrency:

.. code-block:: python

   from memories.concurrency import TaskManager
   
   # Create a task manager
   task_manager = TaskManager(max_concurrent=5)
   
   # Add tasks to the manager
   task_manager.add_task(fetch_imagery(location1))
   task_manager.add_task(fetch_imagery(location2))
   
   # Wait for all tasks to complete
   results = await task_manager.gather()

Caching System
------------

A multi-level caching system for optimizing performance:

.. code-block:: python

   from memories.cache import Cache
   
   # Create a cache
   cache = Cache(name="imagery_cache", max_size_gb=2)
   
   # Try to get data from cache
   key = f"imagery_{location}_{time_range}"
   imagery = cache.get(key)
   
   if imagery is None:
       # Data not in cache, fetch it
       imagery = await fetch_imagery(location, time_range)
       # Store in cache for future use
       cache.set(key, imagery, ttl_days=30)

Deployment Options
================

The ``memories-dev`` framework supports multiple deployment options:

Local Deployment
--------------

For development and small-scale usage:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Install the package
   pip install memories-dev
   
   # Run a local script
   python my_analysis_script.py

Server Deployment
---------------

For multi-user environments:

.. code-block:: python

   from memories.server import MemoriesServer
   
   # Create and start the server
   server = MemoriesServer(
       host="0.0.0.0",
       port=8000,
       workers=4,
       max_memory_gb=16
   )
   
   server.start()

Cloud Deployment
--------------

For scalable, distributed processing:

.. code-block:: python

   from memories.cloud import CloudDeployment
   
   # Configure cloud deployment
   deployment = CloudDeployment(
       provider="aws",
       region="us-west-2",
       min_instances=2,
       max_instances=10,
       auto_scaling=True
   )
   
   # Deploy the application
   deployment.deploy("my_application.py")

Design Principles
===============

The architecture of the ``memories-dev`` framework is guided by several key design principles:

1. **Modularity**: Components are designed to be modular and interchangeable, allowing users to swap out implementations or add new capabilities.

2. **Asynchronous First**: The framework is built around asynchronous programming to enable efficient handling of I/O-bound operations like data retrieval.

3. **Scalability**: The architecture supports scaling from single-machine deployments to distributed cloud environments.

4. **Extensibility**: The framework is designed to be easily extended with new data sources, models, and applications.

5. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between data acquisition, memory management, model integration, and applications.

6. **Progressive Disclosure**: Simple interfaces for common tasks, with the ability to access more advanced features when needed.

7. **Resilience**: Robust error handling, retry mechanisms, and fallback strategies to handle failures gracefully.
