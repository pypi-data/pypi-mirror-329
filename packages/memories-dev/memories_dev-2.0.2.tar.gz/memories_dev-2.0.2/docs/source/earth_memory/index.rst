Advanced Features
==============

Earth Memory includes several advanced features that enhance its capabilities:

Asynchronous Processing
--------------------

Earth Memory uses asynchronous processing to efficiently handle multiple data sources and analysis tasks:

.. code-block:: python

    import asyncio
    from memories.earth.processing import BatchProcessor
    
    # Initialize batch processor
    processor = BatchProcessor()
    
    # Define processing tasks
    async def process_locations():
        locations = ["New York, NY", "Los Angeles, CA", "Chicago, IL", "Houston, TX"]
        tasks = [processor.process_location(location) for location in locations]
        results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
        return results
    
    # Run processing
    results = asyncio.run(process_locations())

Multi-dimensional Scoring
----------------------

Earth Memory uses sophisticated scoring algorithms to evaluate locations across multiple dimensions:

.. code-block:: python

    from memories.earth.scoring import MultiDimensionalScorer
    
    # Initialize scorer
    scorer = MultiDimensionalScorer()
    
    # Define scoring dimensions
    scorer.add_dimension("environmental_quality", weight=0.3)
    scorer.add_dimension("accessibility", weight=0.2)
    scorer.add_dimension("amenities", weight=0.2)
    scorer.add_dimension("safety", weight=0.3)
    
    # Score a location
    scores = await scorer.score_location(
        location="Portland, OR",
        dimensions=["environmental_quality", "accessibility", "amenities", "safety"]
    )
    
    # Get overall score
    overall_score = scorer.calculate_overall_score(scores)

Vector-Based Storage
-----------------

Earth Memory uses vector-based storage for efficient retrieval of similar locations or features:

.. code-block:: python

    from memories.earth.vector_store import VectorStore
    
    # Initialize vector store
    vector_store = VectorStore()
    
    # Store location embedding
    await vector_store.store(
        location="Seattle, WA",
        embedding=location_embedding,
        metadata={"population": 737015, "region": "Pacific Northwest"}
    )
    
    # Find similar locations
    similar_locations = await vector_store.find_similar(
        embedding=location_embedding,
        top_k=5
    )

Distributed Processing
-------------------

Earth Memory supports distributed processing for handling large-scale data:

.. code-block:: python

    from memories.earth.distributed import DistributedProcessor
    
    # Initialize distributed processor
    processor = DistributedProcessor(
        num_workers=4,
        worker_type="process"
    )
    
    # Process data in distributed mode
    results = await processor.process_batch(
        locations=locations,
        analysis_type="comprehensive"
    )

Best Practices
============

Follow these best practices when working with Earth Memory:

1. **Start with Specific Locations**
   
   Begin with well-defined locations rather than large regions to optimize performance.

2. **Use Appropriate Resolution**
   
   Match data resolution to your needs - higher resolution requires more processing resources.

3. **Implement Caching**
   
   Enable caching to improve performance for frequently accessed locations.

4. **Optimize Memory Tier Usage**
   
   Configure memory tiers based on your access patterns and storage capabilities.

5. **Use Asynchronous Processing**
   
   Leverage asynchronous processing for handling multiple locations or data sources.

6. **Implement Error Handling**
   
   Add robust error handling for API requests and data processing.

7. **Monitor Resource Usage**
   
   Keep track of memory and CPU usage, especially when processing large datasets.

8. **Validate Results**
   
   Implement validation checks to ensure analysis results are accurate.
