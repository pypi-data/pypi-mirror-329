This is a distributed application cache build on top of the Python Ordered dictionary.
It uses UDP multicast as the transport hence the name "Multi-Cast Cache", playfully abbreviated to "McCache".

2023-09-10:
    To implement a peer-to-peer communication will be a big management overhead.
    As the cluster is coming online subsequent nodes could miss the prior announcement.
    All the nodes need to setup their connections to connect to all the other cluster members.

    Instead, I am thinking of using the the same multi-cast infrastructure to communicate among the members of the cluster.
    `ACK` packets are small and UDP is faster than TCP.  Modern switches are reliable managing ports thus reducing collision.
    Draft design:
        - New member multicast their presence but member that is coming online later will have missed this announcement.
            - Upon receiving any operations, we check the `members` collection for existence.  Add it, if it doesn't exist.
            - Upon receiving the `BYE` operation, remove it from the `members` collection.
        - `DEL` and `UPD` operations will require acknowledgment.
            - A `pending` dictionary shall be used to keep track of un-acknowledge keys.
                - We queue up a `ACK` operation to be multicast out.
            - All members in the cluster will receive other members acknowledgements.
                - If the received acknowledgment is not in one's `pending` collect, just ignore it.
                - The house keeping thread shall monitor the acknowledgement and request re-acknowledgement.
                    - Keys that have not received an acknowledgement after the seasoning period,
                      a re-acknowledgment `RAK` is initiated.
                    - If we haven't receive acknowledgement after the seasoning period,
                      we log a `warning` or `critical` message.
                        - Remove the key from the `pending` collection.
                        - Remove the key from the `member`  collection.
                            - The member node is down.
            - Members in the cluster will be receiving message from the other members.
              Fragments of the message shall be maintained in memory until the entire message can be re-assembled.

    We will target a 50ms latency or better with the following rough guide:
        -   <30  ms little or no impact on user experience
        - 30-60  ms still OK but noticeable for certain applications (gaming etc.)
        - 60-100 ms mostly acceptable, but users do start to feel it: websites a little slower, downloads not fast enough, etc
        -100-150 ms user feels typically that "the Internet is slow".
        -   >150 ms "it works", but is not acceptable for most commercial applications these days

    Competition:
    So far I have not able to search for anything out on the internet that is doing what this project is doing.
    There is a Python project call `DistCache` but upon digging deeper it is a frontend to Redis.
        https://pypi.org/project/distcache/

    Are we so crazy to think of this design and implementation?
    Surely, this is a solved problem or the herd mentality is on the client-server model.
