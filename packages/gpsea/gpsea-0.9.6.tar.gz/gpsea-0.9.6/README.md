GPSEA (Genotypes and Phenotypes - Statistical Evaluation of Associations) is a Python package for finding genotype-phenotype associations.

See our documentation for the [setup](https://monarch-initiative.github.io/gpsea/stable/setup.html) instructions,
a [tutorial](https://monarch-initiative.github.io/gpsea/stable/tutorial.html) with an end-to-end genotype-phenotype association analysis,
and a comprehensive [user guide](https://monarch-initiative.github.io/gpsea/stable/user-guide/index.html) with everything else.

The documentation comes in two flavors:

- [Stable documentation](https://monarch-initiative.github.io/gpsea/stable/) (last release on `main` branch)
- [Latest documentation](https://monarch-initiative.github.io/gpsea/latest) (bleeding edge, latest commit on `develop` branch)
