## PTSAMESITE - Same Site Scripting Detection Tool

ptsamesite is a tool designed to detect same-site scripting vulnerabilities across various domains.

## Installation

```
pip install ptsamesite
```

## Adding to PATH
If you're unable to invoke the script from your terminal, it's likely because it's not included in your PATH. You can resolve this issue by executing the following commands, depending on the shell you're using:

For Bash Users
```bash
echo "export PATH=\"`python3 -m site --user-base`/bin:\$PATH\"" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

For ZSH Users
```bash
echo "export PATH=\"`python3 -m site --user-base`/bin:\$PATH\"" >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

## Usage examples
```
ptsamesite -d example.com                               # Test domain
ptsamesite -d example.com example2.com                  # Test two domains
ptsamesite -d subdomain1.subdomain2.example.com -s      # Test domain along with all subdomains
ptsamesite -f domain_list.txt                           # Test domains from a file
ptsamesite -f domains_list.txt -s -t 100 -V             # Test domains from a file with all subdomains, set threads to 100 and print only vulnerable domains
```

## Options
```
-d  --domain      <domain>   Test domain
-f  --file        <file>     Test domains from file
-s  --subdomains             Test all subdomains of given domain (default False)
-t  --threads     <threads>  Set number of threads (default 20)
-V  --vulnerable             Print only vulnerable domains
-v  --version                Show script version and exit
-h  --help                   Show this help message and exit
-j  --json                   Output in JSON format
```
