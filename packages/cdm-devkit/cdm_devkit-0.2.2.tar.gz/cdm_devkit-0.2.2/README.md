## Report a bug

If you encountered a one, we recommend to report it using GitHub Issues:

- Open a new issue using [this template](https://github.com/cdm-processors/cdm-devkit/issues/new?template=bug_report.md)
- Provide a proper name and description
- Provide the information on how to reproduce the bug

## Setting up development environment

### Python-based projects

- Install [**Poetry**](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)
- Run `poetry install` at the project root

### Java-based projects

- Install **JDK**
- **Gradle** build system should be downloaded by `gradlew` script automatically on first run

### Visual Studio Code extension

- Install [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en)
  - You will need a package manager, so it's recommended to get a provided **npm** binary from **Node.js** installer
  - However, if you really understand what are you doing, you can use your favorite package manager such as **pnpm**, **Yarn** or (if you are on the cutting edge of progress) even **Bun**
- Navigate to `vscode-cdm-extension`
- Run `npm install`

## Building

### Building individual projects

#### Python-based projects

- Run `poetry build`

#### Java-based projects

- Navigate to project folder;
- For UNIX-like systems:
  - Run `./gradlew jar`
- For Windows:
  - Run `.\gradlew.bat jar`

#### Visual Studio Code extension

- Navigate to `vscode-cdm-extension`
- Run `npx @vscode/vsce package`

### Building all projects at once

There is a handy `Makefile` that will build all projects and prepare artifacts for distribution: just run `make` to build all projects.

> [!TIP]
> You can set a `VERSION` variable if you want to specify the project version; note that it should be a valid [SemVer](https://semver.org/) version.
>
> Example: `make VERSION=1.2.3`

## Contributing

If you want to participate in the development of the project, we are open to your **pull requests**!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We expect all commit messages to comply [these guidelines](https://gist.github.com/robertpainsi/b632364184e70900af4ab688decf6f53) and use **scope identifier(s)** - the name of the subproject enclosed in square brackets. However, if the commit applies to the entire repository, **scope identifier** must be omitted.

An example message: `[cocas] Add new target`
