## Installation

To install the package, clone the repository and install the dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://codebase.helmholtz.cloud/ai-consultants-dkrz/DeepTrees.git
cd DeepTrees

## create a new conda environment
conda create --name deeptree
conda activate deeptree
conda install -c conda-forge gdal==3.9.2 pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
or from pip.

```bash
pip install deeptrees
```

## Documentation

This library is documented using Sphinx. To build the documentation, run the following command.

```bash
sphinx-apidoc -o docs/source deeptrees 
cd docs
make html
```

This will create the documentation in the `docs/build` directory. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the documentation.

## Predict on a list of images

Run the inference script with the corresponding config file on list of images.

```bash
from deeptrees import predict

predict(image_path=["list of image_paths"],  config_path = "config_path")
```


## Scripts

### Preprocessing

#### Expected Directory structure

The root folder is `/work/ka1176/shared_data/2024-ufz-deeptree/polygon-labelling/`. Sync the folder `tiles` and `labels` with the labeled tiles provided by UFZ. The unlabeled tiles go into `pool_tiles`.

```
|-- tiles
|   |-- tile_0_0.tif
|   |-- tile_0_1.tif
|   |-- ...
|-- labels
|   |-- label_tile_0_0.shp
|   |-- label_tile_0_1.shp
|   |-- ...
|-- pool_tiles
|   |-- tile_4_7.tif
|   |-- tile_4_8.tif
|   |-- ...
```

Create the new empty directories

```
|-- masks
|-- outlines
|-- dist_trafo
```

### Training

Adapt your own config file based on the defaults in `train_halle.yaml` as needed. For inspiration for a derived config file for finetuning, check `finetune_halle.yaml`.

Run the script like this:

```bash
python scripts/train.py # this is the default config that trains from scratch
python scripts/train.py --config-name=finetune_halle # finetune with pretrained model
python scripts/train.py --config-name=yourconfig # with your own config
```

To re-generate the ground truth for training, make sure to pass the label directory in `data.ground_truth_labels`. To turn it off, pass `data.ground_truth_labels=null`.

You can overwrite individual parameters on the command line, e.g.

```bash
python scripts/train.py trainer.fast_dev_run=True
```

To resume training from a checkpoint, take care to pass the hydra arguments in quotes to avoid the shell intercepting the string (pretrained model contains `=`):

```bash
python scripts/train.py 'model.pretrained_model="Unet-resnet18_epochs=209_lr=0.0001_width=224_bs=32_divby=255_custom_color_augs_k=0_jitted.pt"'
```

#### Training Logs

View the MLFlow logs that were created during training.

TODO

### Inference

Run the inference script with the corresponding config file. Adjust as needed.

```bash
python scripts/test.py --config-name=inference_halle
```


## Semantic Versioning
This reposirotry has auto semantic versionining enabled. To create new releases, we need to merge into the default `finetuning-halle` branch. 

Semantic Versionining, or SemVer, is a versioning standard for software ([SemVer website](https://semver.org/)). Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

- MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes
- MINOR version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
- PATCH version when you make backward compatible bug fixes
- Additional labels for pre-release and build metad

See the SemVer rules and all possible commit prefixes in the [.releaserc.json](.releaserc.json) file.
